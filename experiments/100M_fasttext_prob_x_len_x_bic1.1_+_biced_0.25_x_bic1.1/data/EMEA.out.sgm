<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Department report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or its treatment, please read the package (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendation, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of fusion tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Wirres thought and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychological illness in which patients have alternate periods (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternating with periods of normal sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or the enamel tablets in patients who have difficulties swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dosage should be modified by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells to one another.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole supposedly appears as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-Hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole, like 5-Hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, works to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter to activate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the occurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies lasting up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, over twelve weeks, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased turmoil, compared to that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted trials to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to take in.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg had a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased restlessness than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for inhalation (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled shrubs), acute symptoms (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea, nausea, obstipation (constipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorders, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients presenting the manic episodes relating to treatment with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorders, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients presenting mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes relating to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Abilify abilify abilify the efficacy of abilify in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the start or after the replacement of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celiary and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occur during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia treated with Abilify should be considered, consider reducing the dose or stopping the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychoses that are associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazole treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk estimates for hyperglycemia related adverse events with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic agents treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to combination-bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is recommended if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist FAMotidine, a gastric acid inhibitor, reduces the response rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolisers, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common benefit of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After removal of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose of dosage prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected to rise with a moderate increase in Ariadprazolite concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazl showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphic / 3-methoxymorphine-ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy because of insufficient data on human safety and due to the concerns caused in the reproduction studies of animals, unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotic drugs, patients should be warned against using dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole showed a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinson's, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients suffering from Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment was 53.3% in patients with a haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase for over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely monitored laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphate kinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy and also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of overdosing, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance is mediated via the combination of a partially agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2 and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, Nucleus caucus and the putfile.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operas-controlled trial, 52 percent of responder patients who attended the study medication were similar (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%) in week 52.</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales, defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery-Aberg- Depressions-Rate-Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', in significantly fewer patients an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed a placebo superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a learning effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, who sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum reflections, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole found superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazl showed superior to placebo in the prevention of a bipolar backpack, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyulation of Aripiprazole, N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">Mean exclusion time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole for extensive metabolization via CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolization via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenia do not show gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">There was no indication of clinically significant differences in the ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency in comparison to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in patients with different cirrhosis of the liver (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the function of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal cortex-toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equates to 3 to 10 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 8 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of sulphate conjugates found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for more than 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the 3 and 11 times the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify enamel tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution in patients with astringent and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of the bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedation or blood pressure (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celiary and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occur during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, alternating layers of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to combination-bidities, the use of antipsychotics where weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the segregation was greater compared to the one-time dose of Aripiprazole in a study where healthy subjects Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) were used intramuscular as one-off and who received the same time as Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist FAMotidine, a gastric acid inhibitor, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolisers, compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites can result in joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteasinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After removal of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose of dosage prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) was intramuscular, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole's sole gift.</seg>

<seg id="167">In the long-term study for more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazole was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely monitored laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (Creatinphosphate kinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 hours) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggitizing and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding aggitibility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean recovery from baseline scores on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggibility, a similar efficacy was observed with regards to the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients who attended the study medication were similar (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol (73%) in both groups.</seg>

<seg id="180">111 in a placebo-controlled study for over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, who sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum reflections, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole found superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase, Aripiprazl showed superior to placebo in the prevention of a bipolar backpack, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazole AUC is 90% greater in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazl's injection solution was tolerated well by rats and apes and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15 - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>

<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal cortex-toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, three-quarters of which had previously been anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in the sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane were treated to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer have no difference between the drug and the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The CHMP's Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it must not be given with other drugs in contrast to other paclitaxel chemotherapy drugs to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the placing of Abraxane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for standard anthracycline-containing treatment (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophal count &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy level 3, treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved on degrees of 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose changes in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies have been conducted with patients with impaired renal function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose changes in patients with kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nano-article formulation of paclitaxel, which could have substantially other pharmacological features than other formulation of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the patients no renewed abrasive cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophils has risen to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunction (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">Whereas a clearly associated cardiotoxicity was not proven in connection with Abraxane, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the patients receive nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea after the use of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual anti-emetic and constiptive methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be applied in pregnant women or in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, unless the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to the treatment of sperm conservation, as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect the traffic and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were once treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most striking important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was fast reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Listed in Table 1 are the side effects associated with the addition of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burn, dry mouth, aching gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in limbs, muscular weakness, very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal relationship with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a timiatomotubules substance that promotes the amalgamation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by blocking their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cellular functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transedthelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 nightingreceptor and a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor because of the albuminous protein SPARC (cream acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two armed unaffiliated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg. / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter trial was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel all 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with prevention of allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 than 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastasis and 19% due to metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-Line therapy are stated below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy level 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to diminish baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active agents (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous administration of Abraxane on patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a wide-ranging extravascularly distribution and / or weight binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with an intravenous 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg. / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microbe and tissue layers, paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data were available about patients at the age of 75, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was proofed at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in front of light light for more than 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic agent and, as in other potentially toxic substances, caution should be observed when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into an Abraxane leakage bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After full addition of the solution, the bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the leakage bottle should be swivelled slowly and gently for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until complete resuspension of the powder is performed.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitation or intoxicants are visible, the bottle must be gently inverted again in order to achieve complete resuspension before the application.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and packaging inserts. • With unique imaging of the correct application of the product, cooling boxes are provided for transport by the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that abseamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels where complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation, abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or supervisor, provided they have received an appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be monitored before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency or that the body does not adequately address the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was introduced which empowers them to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to the reference medicine in a case study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to amed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of amed abseamed and those of Eprex / Erypo were examined in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from renal problems caused by kidney problems, haemoglobin values were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, pungent migraine-like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that in abseamed according to the provisions of the European Union, evidence was provided that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted approval to Medice Medice medicinal Pütter GmbH & Co KG for placing abseamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of the need for transfusion in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma who receive chemotherapy and the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the start of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / l] (no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger surgical procedures which require large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">In order to reduce foreign blood, abseamed can be applied to a large elective orthopaedical procedure in adults with no iron deficiency, where a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">Hb 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml applied not to participate in an autologous blood donor program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Haemoglobin concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the haemoglobin concentration is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anemia symptoms and effects may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin readings can be observed in a patient over or below the haemoglobin concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is needed to control anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using IV application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anemia symptoms and sequelae may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for the control of the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the haemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reciprocity number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be retained three times a week or 450 I.U. per week once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reciprocity number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week of haemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reciprocity number increased by ≥ 0,62 mmol / l, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the haemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the reciprocity number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, an approach to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, should be taken twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donor program - large iron reserves are available before the start of the abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. per kg of epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each for 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who suffer from a erythroblastocytin (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) in the treatment with some erythropoetin should not receive an abseamed or another erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastoenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous rombosis (e.g. venous venous thromboembolilies).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are not part of an autologous blood donor program: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently entered heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenie (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effectiveness, defined as a decrease in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the receptor deficiency should be determined and the usual causes of failure to respond (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminescence toxication, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the erythropocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the erythrocyte "index"), is reduced (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of effect is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered to diagnose a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in the subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk of an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the gift of epoetins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased above the concentration required for control of the anemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should not exceed 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestion insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet to be dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In the case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoietin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may have to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a b-value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic occurrences (see section 4.2) of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">If possible, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly, if possible, before the onset of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a major orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular disease, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been shown to improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a hemoglobin target was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose can be adjusted to rising hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no indication of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding haematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular attacks, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thromboses, hemorthromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetine.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoietin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically modified epoetin alfa is glycosified and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoetin isolated from the urine of anaemia.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently suffered hip fractures; the number of fractures was examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, in two studies Aclasta was tested in a total of 357 patients and compared to risedronate for six months (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood returned to normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without osteoporosis emedicine) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without osteoporosis emedicine).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fractures 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zinc phosphonate or other bisphosphonate or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions at the infusion point and osteonecsis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Aclasta manufacturer provides information material for physicians who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued approval to the Novartis Europharm Limited Company for Aclasta's placing in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package is to be provided and the following key messages include: • The packaging fee • Contract contraindication in pregnancy and nursing women • Required about adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When it is resorted to medical or nursing care</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men is an intravenous infusion of 5 mg accorlasta once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of Aclasta infusion is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip fractures (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After the treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate supply of calcium, equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol can be reduced by acetamol or ibuprofen after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function (see Section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, as data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinin-clearances &lt; 35 ml / min), because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">A preexisting hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the onset of treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledronic acid on the bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate supply of calcium, equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids (bad oral hygiene) should be examined before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dentistry.</seg>
<seg id="604">There is no data available to patients who need dental interventions to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after Aclasta's application (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of serious side effects reported cases of atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 from 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), random (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function Coledronic acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which, as a decrease in the kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinine) and in rare cases, expressed kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Creatinin Clearance (measured annually prior to administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study for osteoporosis over three years compared to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium assets below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2.10 mmol / l) were observed in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of zoledronic acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the infusion point, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area was, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area) which were treated with bisphosphonates, including orioledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of these reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study of 7,736 patients performed osteoarthritis in the jaw area with a patient treated with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdosing, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation of oral calcium and / or intravenous calciumgluconate intravenous infusion can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was identified in postmenopausal women (7,736 females aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) T-Score for the femoral hamen ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric properties of the spine decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta had an equally lasting effect over three years which resulted in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density of lumbar spine by 6.7%, the whole hip by 6.0%, the femoral neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology For 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic ridge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer-tomographic (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volumes and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta decreased significantly by 30% after 12 months compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the baseline value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD at all times in comparison to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% over 24 months compared to placebo treatment and 4.3% on the skull.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated at 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the yearly administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the random variation of the lumbar vertebra-BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients over the age of 30 with radiologically confirmed, particularly light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6x to 3,0times age-specific upper normal value when entering the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day during 2 months has been demonstrated in two six months comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risheliat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as respondents at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be enrolled in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Aclasta and the 107 patients treated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response of 141 of patients treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 of the patients treated with Risheliat, was maintained for an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Thereafter, the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the peak value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ = 1.87 hours followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal elimination time of ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above mentioned t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid absorption in bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration versus time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of metabolic substances metabolized by cytochromium P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or not a direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Coledron acid correlated with the Creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Creatinin Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50-80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function up to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the corionic acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney function (creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In the case of studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC are the 6x of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application the renal tolerability of Zoledronic acid in rats was determined by dose of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15 minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application in cumulated expositions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spongiosa in the Metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats showed teratogeneity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) deformities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed on rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledron acid is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the disease pathogen Paget.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens formed by androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction occurs too fast, and new bone material is set up unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing the bone structure, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus adding strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">When using Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines, or have recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta together with food and drink, be sure to take sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Aclasta according to your doctor's instructions.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an infusion into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Aclasta works for a long time, you may need another dose only after a year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work for more than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Aclasta was missed, please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before termination of treatment with Aclasta case you are considering termination of treatment with Aclasta, please take your nearest doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Adverse events associated with the first infusion often occur (in more than 30% of patients), but are less frequent after the ensuing infusion.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache, occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">Currently it is unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Department report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), metformin alone can not be satisfactorily set in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonyl resins or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphonyl resins or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulphonyl resins or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level is reduced, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in triple therapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resin, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">The studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has led to a reduction in HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional application of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonyl resin was reduced by 0.94% in HbA1c, while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin, decreased the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were blurred vision, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiology (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high level of ketone).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted approval to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing an account in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, domed and on one side bear the marker "15" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. a heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed with signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac safety.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in congestive heart failure reports, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be examined.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be led to clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present.</seg>
<seg id="775">A dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated in clinical trials with pioglitazone, which can be caused by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) occurred in the treatment with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haematokrits by 3.1-2% and haematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulphonyl resin or as a double-combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, the treatment with thiazoldindiones, including pioglitazone, was reported, or worsening of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence came to 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with picoglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Drug interactions that are metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochromium P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduction of hypersulinemia and increased insulin resistance in pregnancy under treatment with pioglitazone, reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from this data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT ascents exceeded the three times the upper limit of the normal range even more often than under placebo, albeit less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resins.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about cardiac insufficiency under pioglitazone, more frequently, however, if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients was performed in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study lasting over a period of 3.5 years, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with picoglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, followed by 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to function via activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome proliferation receptor-activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose availability in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazone versus Gliclafranc as a monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclaity).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was not discontinued with insulin despite a three-month optimization phase were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients receiving only insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotient showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetics for 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, a reduction in overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol and a slight, but clinically significant elevated LDL cholesterol level were observed in most clinical trials compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced total plasma glycerides and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo, metformin or gliclages and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol in Pioglitazone, while lower values were observed under metformin and gliclages.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this both about an effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized into groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">This is based on the contribution of M-IV to the effectiveness of the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it could be proven that pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochromium P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochromium P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively labelled pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in decay (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone in humans is 5-6 hours, and that of the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearing of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies mice, rats, dogs and monkeys converged after repeated administration of plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the reduction in hypersensitivity and increased insulin resistance in the formation of pioglitazone, reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazoldindiones resulted in increased frequency of colonic cancer.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat, and on one side bear the marking "30" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence came to 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with picoglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were investigated using either pioglitazone or gliclages.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year ago, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotient showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this both about an effect on the Tryglycerid absorption as well as the hepatic tryglizard synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the goal of its primary endpoint, which presented a combination of the total mortalities, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary aryocardia, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary regascularisation and the revascularization of leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular disease risk is associated with the use of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat, and on one side bear the marker "45" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients who received comparative medication, showed an increased incidence of fractures in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with picoglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this both about an effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly through intensive insulin therapy, for example, can perceive hypoglycemia symptoms and should be consulted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (recombinant DNA to insulin-animal origin) can cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when switching to acetphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travelling, which go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his physician, as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used and taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">Therefore, the doctor must take into account the possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients to always consult the medicines they have taken from them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Slow hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which may occur in a non-sufficiently controlled diabetestherapy increase the risk of malformations and fruit tod in utero.</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycaemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycaemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or glucose, given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total working time is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed response.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of split (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after removing the Actraphane leakage bottle from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resuspended according to the user's instructions for the first use.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After 15 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data showing that the alendronate dosage contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed for preventing bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhoea (difficulty breathing), aborted abdomen (blower abdomen) and acidic bumping.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE may not be used in patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following tips are exactly to follow in order to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after rising the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract other than pyloroplasty (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions such as oesophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strikations, were reported in patients taking alendronate (sometimes these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to dismiss the medicine in case of symptoms of malignant irritation like dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after symptoms that indicate esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate no increased risk was found, stomach and duodenal ulcera, among them some serious and complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen mainly administered intravenously administered bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There is no data available that indicates whether the reduction of a bisphosphonate therapy in patients that require a slate surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose ADROVANCE after they have noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral drugs may affect the resorption of alendronate if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, alendronate was used in clinical studies along with a variety of usually prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for the use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or by breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoarthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports are from cancer patients, but also reported in osteoporosis patients.</seg>

<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracturing incidence in postmenopausal women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) as well as in the fracture intervention trial (FIT: n = 6.459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In the phase III studies, the average elevation of BMD with alendronate 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the spine, 5.9% at the femoral neck and 7.8% of the trochanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronat, a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% versus placebo -6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal fractures.</seg>

<seg id="1402">Since Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograf are already in use in the EU, the company has presented the results from previous studies with Prograf / Programs and data from the published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation where the application of Advantf was compared with Prograf / Programs or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a year of treatment (for example, examining how often a new organ transplant or a re-recording of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter other studies have been carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Advantf is absorbed by the body in comparison to Prograf / Programs.</seg>

<seg id="1407">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against tacrolimus, macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin) or any of the other ingredients, advagraf may not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and doctors must be careful if others (in particular some herbal) drugs should be taken at the same time as advagraf as the dose or dose of the medication consumed at the same time need to be adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this drug or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formula and the corresponding daily dosage; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus is preserved.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of advagraf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of graft rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see "recommendations below")</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advantf, the Tacrolimus table mirrors should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the tacrolimus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advantf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate night ransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a substance with low clearances, an adjustment of the advance dose can take several days before the ady state is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition in the first post-operative phase does not allow oral intake of drugs, the Tacrolimus Treatment can be administered intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the preparation of an infusion solution) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress transplant rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dose recommendation - Switching from Prograf to Advantf Must be converted a graft recipient of two daily dose of Prograf Capsules to a once daily dose of Advantf, this conversion has to take place in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressants to advagraf once a day, the treatment can begin with the oral initial dose recommended in renal and liver transplantation for the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation in adult patients who are converted to advagraf is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day to be taken once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Although there is no clinical experience with advagraf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal patients, patients with transplant transplant patients received an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Sinkidney function does not influence the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, a careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of serum carotinosis, a calculation of the creatine stage and a monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporto to Advantf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is recommended (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of graft rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the help of thoroughbred tacrolimus-taldo controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the tacrolimus lattium during the first two weeks following transplant, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood pressure levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to advagraf, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy, or while using substances that could change the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advantf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments to the dose may require several days before the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplants are usually between 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects caused by tacrolimus, under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formula and the corresponding daily dosage; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be a therapistant compared to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarded wording of Advantf are available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients, no clinical data for the retarded wording of Advantf are available.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum) is to be avoided during a treatment with advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, since the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a hypertrophy known as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under anagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to possible risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking Tacrolimus seem to show symptoms for PRES such as headache, altered state of consciousness, cramps and vision disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while adding substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain even concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole, and Voriconazole and with the Macroeyelid antibiotic Erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the hormone level, decisions on contraceptive measures should be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially lower the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients do not show that under tacrolimus, there is an increased risk of adverse events relative to the course and outcome of pregnancy compared to other immunosuppressants.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, monitoring of the newborn to possible adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys) is recommended.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative disorders and skin tumours in conjunction with tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high bond of erythrocytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are mediated by its binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of lymphokinos genes.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 patient-transplanted patients, in 475 patients who underwent pancreatitis and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant were used as a primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf corresponded to observations in the major studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral Prograf, more than 110 patients were reported, who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, in 21,7% of cases, the incidence of bronchiolitis was obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0,02) than the number of patients who were switched from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was increased after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of bronchiolitis of obliter- syndroms in patients treated with tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicenter study with oral Prograf was performed on 205 patients who underwent pancreatic and kidney transplantation at the same time, who received a randomised procedure tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the desired valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">On 155 patients (65 only gut, 75 liver and intestine and 25 multiviszeral transplants), the published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral program showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low hematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound faction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearances observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, with the excretion mainly done via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose, systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than in Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital heart disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of use depend on whether it is used to treat haemorrhages or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was introduced that it empowers the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to a medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is made otherwise, so that the drug does not contain any proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies involving patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures has been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the effectiveness of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new hematocytes with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Lawyers may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to Baxter AG to promote the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy are based on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the place and extent of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of subsequent hemorrhagic events, Factor VIII activity in the appropriate period shall not fall below the given plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until pain and acute depression are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, reach different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses of between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by a proper dose, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII-therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be based on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of people with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the pro-coagulatory activity of factor VIII immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the magnitude of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposures is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pretreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositional days and amnestic known inhibitory development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the occurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs encountered in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of which had a higher risk of inhibitors formation, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected decline of the VIII-mirror coagulation factor occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively day) in a patient with continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and both the Factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma as well as the clearing rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th postoperatively day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed low inhibitors (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 expositions.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, no FVIII inhibitor was found in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were treated with inhibitors of factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients to trace contaminating proteins was analysed by investigating antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters, and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, uritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilus granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reported about hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylaktoid reactions (frequency unknown).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated Factor VIII acts as a co-factor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated Factor X from factor X.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All pharmacokinetical studies with ADVATE were performed on pre-treated patients with severe or moderate hemophilia A (baseline of factor VIII-activity ≤ 2%).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP based on the ADVATE security profile, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company accepts its application for approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and thus no infection in humans can trigger.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to reconstruct the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defects in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni-Krebs, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient where Li-Fraumeni cancer occurred in the abdominal area, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the company's answers to the questions he had asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial documents submitted, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP there was not enough evidence that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumours is beneficial to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company does not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "changed active release" "" "" "" "means that the tablets are put together in such a way that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other slowly over a few hours." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nose caused by allergies to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years of age, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet, which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of treatment and 15 days of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the trial, patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed using a standard scale, how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms, except the constipation of the nose, the patients who took an aze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients with aero-ze showed alleviation of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chasing), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolency (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeronaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or loratadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aeronaze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), heart or vascular disease including hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrosis) or an haemorrhagic stroke (cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit to transport aerinaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it must be swallowed whole (i.e. without cutting, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aeronaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms finish.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstriktors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestive which can be attributed to peroral or nasal as abnormal Rhineland (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aeronaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function, and data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment must be terminated in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, hydatid obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests because antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or can be reduced to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole was administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of loratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether the loratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of diloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies revealed however no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, it should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in drowsiness which may result in impairment of traffic and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lethal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, anxiety, muscular weakness, increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, preoperative pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil stiffness and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesive agent P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance, including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, there was no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo at the recommended dose of 5 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympomimetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined on the basis of the overall score for the symptoms (except nasal mucous swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient subgroups defined by gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study of the Pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin can be detected within 30 minutes after the plasma is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of diloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was achieved by day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were diloratadin poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine is bioequivalent to exposure to an aeronaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Pharma covigilance system described in March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the application application is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to relieving allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and tearing eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosing the following symptoms or diseases using the Aerinaze: • High blood pressure • Heart chasing, heart palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea and headaches or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking aero with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="1711">In the recommended dosage, it is not expected that aeronaze will lead to dizziness or reduce attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze, you should immediately inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you have forgotten taking Aerinaze if you have forgotten to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin very rarely was reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chasing, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleeping disorders, muscular pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for inserting (soluble tablets), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children at the age of one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children between the ages of 6 and 11, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by determining the change in symptoms (itch, number and size of the square, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to inhale, and the enamel tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom points) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials at Urticaria, the average scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% were compared to 40 and 33% compared to the placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of Aerius in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous illness and can be resumed after the onset of the symptoms and resumed during their reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the case of persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with diloratadin tablets that were administered in addition to erythromycin or ketoconazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in drowsiness which may result in impairment of traffic and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than in placebo were tiredness (1,2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study where up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose) were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesive agent P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses that were administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study where desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">For a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance, including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching the nose, itching, tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the overall live scores of the quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, irrespective of the aetiology, is similar to the different forms and that chronic patients can be recruited more easily and prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine release is a causal factor in all the causes of the urticaria, it is expected that in addition to the chronically idiopathic urticaria, also in other forms of urticaria, the symptoms are improved; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminika in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the disease by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study where patients were similar to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after a daily application of diloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of diloratadin has not yet been identified, so interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo, not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (greasy, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aperius can be taken separately from meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with aperius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomic anomalies, anamnesis, physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabolised by desloratadin and experience higher exposure levels (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which are drastically metabolized, is identical to that in children who are normally metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol, so patients should not use this drug with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucroase-isomaltase- insufficiency.</seg>

<seg id="1782">As shown on the basis of the overall score of the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The dissemination of this restriction metabolizing phenotype was comparable in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with syrup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are drastically metabolized.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company regains its application for authorisation of Aflunov's placing on the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly to protect influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a stem of the flu virus which might cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to man, because people have not yet established immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognizes the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign-foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to produce faster antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this tribe.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane manure of the virus was purified, cleaned and used as part of the vaccine with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as foreign bodies).</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the size of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendation, please read the scientific discussion (also included in the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asphysis should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined the antiviral drugs used by the patient before, and the likelihood of the virus being responded to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between the ages of four and twelve, and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Asphyase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood while taking in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage to the immune system and thereby also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">In 206 adults who used protease inhibitors were compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the viral load change after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not taken a protease inhibitor after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors only responded very few to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the treatment with Ritonavir lowered the viral load following 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV that were resistant to four other protease inhibitors, there was a stronger decrease in the viral load together with Ritonavir after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of asgenase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue syndrome (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Aciase can also not be used in patients who take St. John's Wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicinal products, which are broken down as well as asphyase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, patients who are taking Agenerase are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of agoniasis in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat proteasinhibitors outweigh HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Asecase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of agoniasis in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have not taken protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>

<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited a permit to transport agitase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Aciase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) -pretreated adults and children aged 4 and up.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to take-in is 14% less than from amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, apex-capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram of base are not exchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of aciase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Astostasis is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction should be reduced to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Aciase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic latitude and also substrates of the Cytochrome P450-ion enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that apex or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with apex does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules are to be used along with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction in antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an early administering of Agenerase with lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International Norised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with an amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for the symptoms of opium, especially if also low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propyl glass content of the Agenerase solution, this form of dosage is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set to 5 times if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses associated with medications that were associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In haemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhages including haematosis and haemarthrosis are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response may develop in asymptomatic or residuale opportunistic infections at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial etiology (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecsis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic wide apex can not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic latitude and also substrates of the Cytochrome P450-ion enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir may not be combined with medication whose active ingredients are metabolised predominantly via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects for increased plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC from amprenavir which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenatvirus levels and, if possible, to check the viral load and depose the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nelly avir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, while CMAx is reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies dosages of 600 mg of amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and caletra cannot be given, but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was undertaken to use asphysis in combination with didanosine, but due to the attached component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of didanosin and againase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is necessary in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz combined with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors is low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs are to be used at the same time, caution is recommended since Delavirus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is recommended, a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be done as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous addition of amprenavir and rifabutin leads to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with asphysis, a reduction of the dose of rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once a day led to an increase in CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69times compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions when used together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with apex.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asphyase since it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme reductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir may result in degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Israthpin, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, niisoldipine and verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent intake of Agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with PDE5 inhibitors associated with side effects including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in test subjects, the fluid cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% interval of 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to increase the plasma levels while administering Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may lead to myopathy including a habdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror because the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while using amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase must not be used together with an oral myozolam (see Section 4.3) while using parenteral midazolam while using Agenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteasinhibitors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for the symptoms of opium, especially if also low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to adapt the amprenavir dose if amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Combined with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of debilitating or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods of contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended while using Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful balancing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactating rats, amprenavir-related substances were detected, but it is not known whether prenavir passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, administered by the implantation in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of progeny including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asphysis was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral agents.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely lead to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are in connection with the intake of Agenerase or another drug used at the same time as HIV treatment, or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) which were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and chronic subcutaneous fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated individuals treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over an average duration of 36 weeks was only observed one case (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 patients were treated with amprenavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 cases, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderately severe, erythematous or makulopapulant nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response may develop in asymptomatic or residuale opportunistic infections at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice daily with low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of side effects (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those who received dormant with low dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the process of viral gag and gag polyprotein steps with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro versus HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0,012 to 0,08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not pretreated patients with currently approved fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir-oosterten treatment schemes with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral untreated patients who received 700mg Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure within the 59, with protease inhibitors of previously untreated patients, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 trial and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients with protease inhibitors performed in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypical resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32 I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypical interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypical cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic pattern produces a certain cross resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients, in which a resistance against Lopinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), inavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir keeps its activity against some other protease inhibitory isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failure therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations which may adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study where PI pre-treated adults in virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard of care (standard of care, SOC) were vaccinated with an PI, predominantly with low-dose pritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis assessed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average change from baseline value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-discharge threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbleached asphysis is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, 152 of whom were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase was examined twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered along with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks about 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of "unbleached" asphysis should be considered when optimizing the therapy with PI pretreated children.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir amounts to about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">50 8% increase, by contrast, reduced by 30% for CMAx if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration at the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients fluctuates during dosing intervals depending on the overall concentrations in the stady state over the area of CMAx, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 must be administered with care if they are given at the same time as ageneric (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of asgenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily prenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules, hence the aciase solution and aciase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram-base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, so the effect of a kidney function should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to prenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained twice a day after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous dose of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir of mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas were observed in doses of 2.0 times (mice) or 3,8 times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily offering of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutations tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test of rats and chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral lymphocytes were neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical studies, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither in the administration of apex nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies that were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans, a number of minor changes including thymus gongation and minor skeletal changes were observed that indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If aciase capsules are applied without the intensifying addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of aciase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International Norised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Asphysis should be set to 27 in the long term if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC from amprenavir which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increase, while CMAx is reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and caletra cannot be given, but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz combined with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors is low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is recommended, a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be done as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with asphysis, a reduction of the dose of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Israthpin, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, niisoldipine and verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical trial in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in test subjects, the fluid cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% interval of 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">Combined with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of debilitating or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of ortho-novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of norethindron) led to a 22% decrease in AUC and Cmin by amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful balancing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, administered by the implantation in the uterus to the end of the lactation period amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in body weight during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of asphysis was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral agents.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdosing, the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro versus HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0,012 to 0,08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, amprenavir keeps its activity against some other protease inhibitory isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the expected benefit of "unbleached" asphysis should be considered when optimizing the therapy with PI pretreated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients fluctuates during dosing intervals depending on the overall concentrations in the stady state over the area of CMAx, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2091">In long-term studies on the carcinogenicity with amprenavir of mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas were observed in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8 times (rat) of exposure to humans after two daily doses of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="2097">Generic Agenerase is used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) -pretreated adults and children aged 4 and up.</seg>
<seg id="2098">The benefit of using Ritonavir "geboosterter" Agenerase Solution was neither covered in PI pre-treated patients nor with PI pre-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to take-in is 14% less than from amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, apex-capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram of base are not exchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution to take away (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agenerase is 17 mg (1.1 ml) amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, since no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of Agenerase's solution, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adjustment for amprenavir is not deemed necessary, an application of Agenerase is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glycocolesis, Agenerase is contraindicated in pregnant women, pregnant women, patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>

<seg id="2174">The frequency of application and the duration of the treatment with Aldara depend on the condition to be treated: • In case of small basal cell carcinomas, the cream is to be applied five times per week for six weeks. • In case of actinic keratoses, it is performed three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment, with four weeks breaks between treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Before bedtime the cream is thin-layered to apply to the affected areas of the skin, so that it remains for a long time (about eight hours) on the skin before it is washed off.</seg>
<seg id="2176">In all studies, Aldara was compared with a placebo (the same cream, but without the active agent). • Aldara was tested in four main studies on 923 patients with warts in the genital area for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2177">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated warts. • Aldara was also examined in 724 patients with small basal cell carcinomas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Aldara or the placebo either daily or five times weekly.</seg>
<seg id="2178">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumors after twelve weeks. • Aldara was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with actinic keratoses.</seg>
<seg id="2179">In all studies, Aldara was more effective than the placebo. • In the treatment of warts in the genital area, the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15% to 52% in the patients treated with placebo, but only 3% to 18% in the patients treated with placebo showed a total healing rate of 66% to 80% in the patients treated with Aldara compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="2195">Treatment of basal cell carcinoma with imiquimiodine within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips or hairline was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are common, but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions are regressed after the treatment with Imiquimodine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is required due to the patient's discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions, a treatment break can be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there is currently no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, no clinical experience is available, therefore the application is not recommended for previously treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to Imiquimiodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lipid.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Very limited data are available on the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratosis on the forearms and hands does not support the efficacy in this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the therapy or go back after the therapy with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 active lesions reported a lower healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune stimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although neither once nor after several times of topical application, quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) have been achieved, no recommendation can be applied during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod-Cream in the studies with three-week treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimiodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod-Cream in the related side effects include complaints at the site of application with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalioma patients treated with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, most likely or possibly associated side effect with the application of the Imiquimod cream in these studies was a response to the site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimiodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials with Imiquimiodine treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimiodine are often associated with local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excloriation / graduated (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This according to the test plan assessed the clinical evidence shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream very often resulted in severe Eryissues (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe aphoresis and caking (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of imiquimiodine for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was found with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental one-off oral intake of 200 mg of Imiquimiodine, which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, existed in hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic concentrations of the alphabet and other cytokines were detected following the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, it was shown that the efficacy in the full healing of the genital warts during an Imiquimiodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment was significantly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of all patients treated with Imiquimiodine, the patients were completely healed; this was the case at 20% of the patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 male patients treated with Imiquimiodine compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimiodine at five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficient basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimiodine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 large treatment area on the uncomfortable scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external genital warts, actinic keratoses and superficial- basal cell carcinoma do not generally occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimiodine could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimiodine cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed in the three-week application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weighed 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and in the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the resorption of Imiquimodine after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficiency basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mileage. a study of the dermal application, which was conducted for four months, yielded no similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumors at the application point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk to humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the free cream, formerly and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It may harm other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed side effects can significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● tilt warts (Condylomata acuminata), which have formed on the skin in the area of the genitals (genital organs) and anus (anus), is a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can result in distortions, especially in the face - for this reason, early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to exposure to sunlight during their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied to flat actinic keratoses in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system, where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratosis or the virus responsible for the infection with genital warts.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have used Aldara cream or other similar preparations, please inform your doctor about this before starting with the treatment. o Inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system. o Do not use Aldara cream until the area to be treated after a previous medication or surgical treatment is cured.</seg>
<seg id="2249">If there are reactions in the treated area, which prepare you severe discomfort, wash the cream with a mild soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="2250">As soon as the reactions are cleared, you can continue the treatment. o inform your doctor if they don't have a normal blood pattern</seg>
<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not carried out under the foreskin, swelling, fertilisation of the skin or difficulty can be expected when retracting the foreskin.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not use Aldara cream in the urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina), the cervix (uterine cervix) or within the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medications may have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse with genital warts in the genital area during the infection, treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) is to be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied even if it is not a prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeeding your baby during treatment with Aldara cream is not known as it is not known if iodquimod takes over into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of genital warts, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin with the tilt warts and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully drafted.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with genital warts under the foreskin have to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2) What do you need to consider before using Aldara cream? ").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks a sufficient amount of Aldara cream can be applied for 5 days a week in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you don't feel comfortable while using Aldara cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin reacts too strongly to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not continue using the cream, wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more vulnerable to infection; it can cause you to develop a blue stain faster, or it can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions, which end up again within about 2 weeks after the treatment is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients notice changes in the place of application (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scabbing, skin destruction, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the site (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, slight swollen areas in the skin, tingling, irritation or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, congestion, swelling of the eyelids, throat, facial swelling, ulcer, body aches, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: increased liver, stiff joints, complicating movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of aldurazyme should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing equipment, and patients may need drugs before the administration to prevent allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study focused primarily on the safety of the drug, but it also measured its effectiveness (by examining its effect with regard to the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Frequent side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be highly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will check all new information that may be known, and where necessary to update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">Aldurazyme manufactures patients who receive aldurazyme in terms of reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for placing Aldurazyme in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with aldurazyme should be done by a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient tolerates this every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effect associated with infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an adequate clinical environment where revitalizing facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients are IgG antibodies to laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience regarding re-recording the treatment after a long break, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions following an interruption of treatment must be cautiously avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the onset of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyrotors) to be treated to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / isbuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquin or Procain, because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data on newborns exposed to Laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants less than 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table: very often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-induced shareholding in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing downtime and obverse edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe expiration form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg IV every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients received a serokonversion within 3 months from the start of the treatment, with a more severe progression in the patient at the age of 5 (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature exit from the study), 13 / 45 patients were not present in 13 / 45 patients due to radioimmunoglobitation (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom it had never come to Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with absence of up to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody tides a variable reduction of GAG in urine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginally to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasoning behind enzyme therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the Accumulated Substrats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken up by cells into the Lysosomes, most likely via manÂ "6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were investigated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study covering the entire spectrum of the disease, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and ability to be treated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lung capacity increased further proportionately to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Out of 26 patients with a Hepulegaly in front of treatment reached 22 (85%) up to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of GAG mirrors in the urine (µg / mg of creatinine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account the clinically significant changes across five modes of efficacy (expected procentuales normal FEV, range in the 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-wide open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks because of increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the mean follow-up (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up had a normal mental development speed whereas in older patients with severe hemorrhage-form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies of pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosage schemes were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg IV every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg IV intravenously every 2 weeks can represent an alternative alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in a unique application, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2347">Instructions for handling - dilution and application The concentrate for the production of an infusion solution must be diluted prior to the application and is provided for intravenous application (see information for doctors and medical professionals).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient tolerates this every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I- due involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, however, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing downtime and obverse edema.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (incidence of more than 1 out of 10 patients): • headaches • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • Joint diseases, joint pain, back pain, pain in the arms and legs • Increased pulse • hypertension • reduced oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the Infusion Point</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the packaging fee will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not used immediately, it is not stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, provided the dilution is done under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Depending on the body weight of each patient first, determine the number of bottles to be diluted.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (medicine against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or spread easily to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squamous epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole treatment for patients who have not previously been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regimens.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (drug against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a liquid deficiency) should be given before or after the addition of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood flow changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, dropped or the dose can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetremixed slowed the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed into its active form proceeds more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer term in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was studied in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Amita was also compared to gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin had an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months for the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the mean survival time was 8.3 months compared to docetaxel compared to 7.9 months.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta showed longer survival times than with the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit to transport Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each bottle must be dissolved with 4.2ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is extracted and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with mild, advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, excluding large plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the Pemetremixed-gift as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must continue during the whole treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive intramuscular injection vitamin B12 (1000 mcg.) a week before the first Pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetrexed, a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose test must take place taking into account the presence of the Nadirs of the hemorrhage or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3 which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop nonhematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient loses its value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity of 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reductio- or non-hematological toxicity or so- continued in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients with 65 years of age or over the age of 65 compared to those aged 65 years there is an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to inadequate safety and efficacy data.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with liver dysfunction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper Bilirubin- Border and / or Transaminasenosis of &gt; the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (in the case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the bone marrow and Pemetrexed may not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophilic count again has a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophal count, thrombocyte number and maximum non-hematological toxicity as observed in previous treatment courses (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in degrees of 3 / 4 hematological and nonhaematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was treated if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed have to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic action to reduce treatment-conditioned toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and min. 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with Pemetremixed need to avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space should undergo a drainage of the effusion before the Pemetremixed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetremixed if this substance was commonly administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is caused by Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment tin to seek advice on sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g per day) result in reduced pemetreation with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is therefore recommended if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function (Creatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and min. 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with a long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with Pemetremixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Norised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be applied during pregnancy, except if it is essential and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Given the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the start of treatment to seek advice on the closure of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed passes into the breast milk and unwanted effects on breast-fed infants cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized cisplatin and pemetremixed and 163 patients with mesothelioma who received randomised cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2419">Clinical relevant laboratory toxicity Grade 3 and 4 was compared with the combined results of three individual Pemetremixed monotherapies (n = 164) in phase 2, except neutropenia (12.8% compared to 5.3%) and an increase in Alanine transaminase (15.2% compared to 1.9%).</seg>
<seg id="2420">These differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population, as the Pha- and 2 studies included both chemonaive and clearly pre-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal baseline values of liver function tests.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic antifolate that exerts its effect by interrupting important follilactic metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed works as an antifolate with several points of attack by blocking the thymodylatsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and Glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent key enzymes of de novo Biosynthesis of thymid- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomized, single-blind Phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin for patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant benefit of a median 2.8-month survival compared to those patients who were only treated with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medication (randomized and treated) in the treatment arm.</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement in clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with malignant pleural cancer was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the alltogether Cistro- tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms resulted from an improvement in lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicenter, randomised, open phase III trial with ALIMTA against docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was median survival time of 8.3 months with patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and from 7.9 months with docetaxel treated patients (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on the treatment effect on overall survival was assessed in favor of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-plate epithelial histological type (n = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00, p = 0,047) in the benefit of docetaxel (n = 172, 6.2 versus 7.4 months, adjusted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08-2,26, p = 0.018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited data from a randomized, controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for Pemetrexed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) are similar to docetaxel.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients who take Alli and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot drain some fats in the food, resulting in a quarter of the fats that have been supplied with food undigested to the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, 391 obese patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 were compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The study with alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots on the anus, flatus (winch) with stucco, stun pull, oily / oily faeces, oily secretion (rotting), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may not be used in patients who suffer from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or to cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited a permit for placing orlistat GSK in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalical, fat-reduction diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, as there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, as orlistat is only minimally absorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly patients and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Chronic malabsorption syndrome • cholestase • pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich meal or a fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment with alli because the dose of the antidiabetic drug has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as drugs for high blood pressure or higher cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (international normal ratio, INR) may be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical studies up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K, as well as beta carotene, remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take supplements of multivitamin before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamins (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a one-time Amiodarone dose, a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received an orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal and related to the pharmacological effects of the drug because the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100), and very rarely (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side effects observed after the market launch of orlistat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight patients without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid regression of possible systemic effects derives from the lipassable properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect consists in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serin-rest of the gastri and pancreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalical, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change of body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The mean change in total cholesterin came with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (baseline score 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The mean change in LDL cholesterol came with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat was 60 mg (initial value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma was only sporadic and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites were identified in a study involving obese patients, i.e. M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl-leucin group), which represented almost 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any special danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2571">If you omit a meal or a meal does not contain any fat, do not take any capsule. alli can only work if the food contains fat.</seg>
<seg id="2572">If you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat, you risk nutritional supplements (see paragraph 4).</seg>
<seg id="2573">To get used to your new eating habits, start with a calorie and fat-reduction diet already before the first intake of capsules.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Nutrition diaries are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat, how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits.</seg>
<seg id="2575">To safely reach your target weight, you should set two daily targets in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.</seg>
<seg id="2576">• You eat oily to reduce the likelihood of diet-related side effects (see section 4). • Try to move more before you start taking the capsules.</seg>

<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the effects of the capsules, resulting in increased fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the start of treatment, since at this time you might not have consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize dietary factors: • Begin already a few days, or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood of you to exceed your fat limit decreases. • Share your recommended fat amount evenly on daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal, not to take it in the form of a fat-rich main court or a nutritious dessert, as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction. • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms occur learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Keep out of reach of children. • Do not store it any longer after the expiry date indicated on the box. • Keep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture. • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silicagel that serve to keep the capsules dry.</seg>

<seg id="2597">Select meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat healthily.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you can also find on food packaging. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take up to maximum per day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Keep in mind the tables below in this section. • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should consume with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">The amount of calories you use for you can be found below, which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you. • Because of the capsule's function, adherence to the recommended fat intake is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body cannot handle that amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By maintaining the recommended fat intake, you can maximise weight and at the same time reduce the likelihood of diet-related side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without creating frustration and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher is your recommended caloric intake. • "Low physical activity" means that you can walk up steps, work in the garden or do other physical activities daily. • "Medium Physical Activity" means that you can burn 150 kcal every day, for example 3 km walking, 30 to 45 minute gardening work or 2 km running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and adhere to them. • Symbolic is a nutrition journal with information on calorie and fat content of your meals.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The alli program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calories and fat and give guidelines to become more physically active.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alois is used in chemotherapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Alois can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents binding a chemical substance in the body, 5-Hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Alois studied in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Alois showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Alois showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloha (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd to promote the marketing of Alois across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Maxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in highly etogenic chemotherapy based on cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately etogenic chemotherapy based on cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Alois for prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute leus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable when taking palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in patients with whom the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Apart from a further chemotherapy regimen, in the days following chemotherapy, Alois should neither be used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs investigated (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose palonosetron and a Steady-State- Concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">A pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population showed that CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, chlorpromaine, Cimetidine, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience in the application of palonosetron in human pregnancies does not occur, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most frequent side effects of a dose of 250 micrograms were observed (a total of 633 patients), which could at least be related to Alois, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there appeared similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably no effective therapy in case of an aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 docxorubicin and 250 mg. of Dolasetron (half-value for 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron were given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron which were given intravenously day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately etogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly etogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following the findings of pre-clinical examinations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and reolarisation and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of IV palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are usually dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.390 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to IV administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to the value measured after a one-time IV administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after one-time dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of the antagonistic effects on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isodes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Culmination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found in the urine within 144 hours, Palonosetron as an unchanged active agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolt injection in healthy patients the total body of the body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after exposures that are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, indicating a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and replication and can prolong the potential of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose was equivalent to the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given every day for two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Alois is determined in humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) approved a negative opinion in which the failure of approval for the placing of the medicine for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug effective ingredient already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue causes damage, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are elevated in the blood-norm.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates these for the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data demonstrating the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients with the efficacy of the reference medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease increased again in more patients than with the reference doctor; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medication triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection accompanied by crust formation) and small infected infirmations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections which have been proven or presumably caused by methicillint resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarma may not work against this kind of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients with age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cancelled at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in skin wounds, about 90% of patients from both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that in the treatment of abscesses (tissue filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused demonstrably or presumably by MRSA, it is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of altargo outweigh the risks of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmaries, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamina ointment the treatment is canceled, the ointment carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retina should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in clinical studies was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsening of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinol and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations achieved in humans after topical application on abraded skin or infected surface wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole the mean Retapamia AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% retapamination ointment increased from healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adaptations are not necessary if topical retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamination ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of reapamulin is preferable to a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding continues / ended or the therapy with altargo should be continued / terminated, balancing the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo used, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the place of administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic Derivate of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passacerianus (formerly Pleurotus passacerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site of ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, blocking some P-binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50-bosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the use of Retapamulin at least seem questionable at least some infection forms due to the local prevalence of resistance, consultation with experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were observed in the in-vitro activity of retinae compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamination Salbe was applied daily under occlusion to intact and scrubbing skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamina sage twice daily for 5 days of topical treatment of secondary, traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was done on days 3 or 4 of the adult patients before the medication and for the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of the human being after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of skewed skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamia IC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, less participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were indications of adaptive functioning of the liver and thyroid gland.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro analysis on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats-microkernel test for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosing of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been achieved to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application to 200 cm2 of skewed skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>

<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Ambience is used as part of a two-dose plan to protect hepatitis B only after the second dose is administered." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambience may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and that the two doses of the vaccine can be put to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose for hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambience or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines function by contributing to the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambience contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered within a three-dose plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambience and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults are also used as evidence for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six-month and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix initiated between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambience's degree of protection was similar to six and a 12 month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambience (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, mating (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambience may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a permit to the company GlaxoSmithKline.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan with Ambience consists of two doses of vaccine, with the first dose taken at the date of choice and the second dose taken between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a chime is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis B antibody levels are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to hepatitis A vaccination need a refresher vaccine as protection, since they may also be protected by the immunological memory of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value after primerisation, so that the administration of further doses of vaccines may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clots, Ambience can be injected subcutanally, as in these cases it can lead to bleeding after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambience was given in the second year in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mask mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects must assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, mating, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thiglomerate and preservative formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years, Ambience's tolerability was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matedness on a basis of the calculation for each vaccination dose of Ambience, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after receiving Ambience at 50,7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the full vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambience had pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects which had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matedness was comparable per proband (i.e. across the entire vaccine cycle in 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambience, compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and mating was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11-year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambience a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose inoculas with Ambience or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBs were 74,2% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two cans of Ambience and 147 were given the standard combinationary vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than with Ambience hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after the end of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines either received a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambience or a 3-dose inoculation scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambience in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to that, which after inoculation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatite A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial in 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6- month vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambience in the second year of life was given at the same time as a combination of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>

<seg id="2778">They can feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may necessitate a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambience cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete series of vaccines has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B prior to the administration of both vaccination cans, (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ambience or any component of this vaccine including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">Allergic reaction may manifest through itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usual treatment of the second vaccination dosage).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of vaccination with Ambience.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / she will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection against end of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambience is injected into persons suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambience can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to the vaccination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction is to the vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she /</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given to Ambience at the same time, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambience is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Traditionally, Ambience is not given pregnant or lactating women, unless it is urgently necessary to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other ingredients of Ambience Please inform your doctor if your child has shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very often (more than 1 case per 10 leaked doses): • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mateness • irritability • headaches • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">Shocks frequently (up to 1 case per 10 rotated doses): • swelling at the injection site • fever (over 38 ° C) • drowsiness • Gastro-intestinal discomfort</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects that were reported very rarely days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 reported doses) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally restricted or extended rashes which can be itchy or bubble-shaped, swelling of the eyes and face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden loss of blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like complaints, including chills, muscle and joint pain, seizures, dizziness, abuse such as tingling and "ant-run," multiple sclerosis, diseases of the optic nerve, loss of sensation or movement ability of some body parts, severe headaches and stiffness of the neck, interruption of normal brain functions</seg>
<seg id="2802">Fainting inflammation of some blood vessels disorders or feeling of disease, loss of appetite, diarrhoea and stomach pain. impaired liver function test Lymphoma can cause a tendency to bleeding or bruising (bruises) caused by the amount of blood platelets.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambience is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has been known since the issuance of the initial permit for placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambience remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambience was only brought into circulation in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug are limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonsac can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with incomplete enzyme deficiency or hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - split by several single cans to meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonsac could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo) (a placebo).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonsac can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste version, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Ammonts effectively prevented ammonia levels in patients suffering from the urinary cycle to high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonsac was approved under "exceptional circumstances" as only limited information about this drug was available due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifal form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication for the use if a hyperammonic encephalopathy consists in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders AMMONAPS is also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithintrans-carbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders as there is a risk of the formation of oesophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, corresponding 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium bifurylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyate over the liver and kidneys is carried out, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the case of subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal reproduction and increased loss of neurons occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a decreased number of functioning nerve lesions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during lactation (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at 56% of patients at least one adverse event (AE) occurred and at 78% of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate disease, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of surplus nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram recorded sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infused, and the disease itself led to death in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen-free analoga during the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By means of hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen release (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn babies at post partum (but within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were treated with hyperammonia encephalopathy was 100% survival, but even in these patients it was time for many people with mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifal form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygous form of the ornithintrans-amylase deficiency), which were recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a proteinreduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys with glutamine, where phenylacetylglutamine arises.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and with cirrhosis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">According to different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), no phenylacetate in the plasma was detectable in the majority of patients with urea-cycle disorders or hemoglobin.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were repeatedly treated with sodium polybutyl board (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyate had no indicative effects in toxic and non-toxic cans (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow tablets yet, or have given patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal sonar.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithintrans-carbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-turtles were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions occurred in the pyramid cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate disease, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate recorded for each gram is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate in granular form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium polybutyl board.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water prior to use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium polybutylbutyrate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the lactation period, you are not allowed to take AMMONAPS, as the medicine may pass into the mother's milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, imitation of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency reception of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you have forgotten taking AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in hemorrhage (red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, nausea, constipation, unpleasant skin smell, rash, kidney function, weight gain and abnormal lab results.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You must not use AMMONAPS after the expiry date specified on the box and the container after "Applicable to the specified expiry date."</seg>

<seg id="2876">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS evenly on the same single doses or via a gastric thistle (tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal tube (tube that is fed through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31. remove from the container a heaped measuring spoon of granulate. • Take a straight edge, e.g. a knife bridge over the top edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess granulate. • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, decreased blood supply to the heart), for example, in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous measured value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart in patients with angina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often used a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abcixmab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing PCI, angiox was as effective in all indicators as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivaliddin, other hirudine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as with people suffering from high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initialdose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous addition of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another sequence, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">A bolt load of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately prior to the procedure followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a direct subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allsome kind of Bolus gift from Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt load of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be made.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolt dosage is quickly given intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second intake of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose can be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate-severe kidney damage, included in the phase III- PCI-study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalidatdin Bolus without a dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox may be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intravenous administration of fractionated heparin or 8 hours after subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Superintentional hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a disruption of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and with dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivaliddin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of the bleeding of arterial points occur in PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can perform bleedings throughout the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving Warfarin and being treated with Bivaliddin, monitoring of the INR-value (International Norised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with Bivaliddin again reaches the existing level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytic or Thrombocyte Generations), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bio-validdin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters can be monitored regularly in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experiments are insufficient regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalidatdin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalidatdin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractional Heparin or Enoxenin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the biopsy group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women as well as patients over the age of 65 were more prone to undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy bleedings were defined according to ACUITY and Timi scales for heavy bleeding as in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleedings performed significantly less than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivaliddin plus GPIIb / III- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severely bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point of point, reduction of haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reduction of haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding looses that occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" points of point, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bivaliddin in 6000 patients undergoing PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the biopsy group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women as well as patients over the age of 65 were more prone to undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleedings performed significantly less than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported in practice following extensive use and are grouped according to system organ classes in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with Bivaliddin can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains a direct and specific thromboinhibitor, which binds to both the catalytic centre and the anion-bladder region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is present in the liquid phase or in clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivaliddin to thromboine, and therefore its effect, is reversible because Thrombin, on its part, slowly splits the binding of Bivalidatdin-ARG3-Pro4, thus regenerating the function of the active center of thromboine.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Moreover, a blood thrombocytopenia / heparininduced Thromboses syndrome (HIT / HITTS) in the past could not induce thrombocytes-aggregating reaction in the past with serum from patients in which it had occurred in the past to heparininduced thromboses / heparininduced thromboses syndrome (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivaliddin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect proven by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was found following a PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg of Bivalidatdin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary aryngeal syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in Arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the onset of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study the characteristics of high risk patients who required angiography in 72 hours were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients underwent fluorescein angiography in 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year data for the total population (ITT) and for patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidocgrel according to protocol (before angiography or prior to PCI) are shown in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopdogrel before angiography or prior to PCI 1 A ACUITY systemic bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperito-Neal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point of point, reduction of haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple end points of a randomized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients who have undergone a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">Pharmacokinetic properties of Bivaliddin were evaluated in patients undergoing cutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that as Peptide a catabolism is going through a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent devaluation of the amino acids in the body-pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the splitting of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by Thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a process of first order with a terminal half-time of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity of animals in repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10 times of clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) was limited to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Adverse events as a result of longer-term physiological exposure as response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short term exposure to those in clinical use, even at very much higher doses.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the manufacturing of the ready-to-use solution 17 does not take place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose trough bottles of type 1 glass to 10 ml which is sealed with a butyl rubber stopper, sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml of sterile water for injection purposes are given into a leaky bottle of Angiox and slightly waved until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are extracted from the bottle and diluted with 5% glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml Bivalidatdin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from 6 years with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and shorter acting time than a short-acting insulin-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot operate insulin effectively, Apidra was studied in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined in six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin liseconds.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0,30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin ulisin or one of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin availability, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with reduced liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the brand (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may result in a change in insulin needs.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 inadequate dosing or termination of a treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching from a patient to another insulin type or insulin should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycemia depends on the profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances which can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or missing under the influence of sympathatholytics such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserve pin.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between the Insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulis overcomes into human breast milk, but generally insulin does not exceed the mother's milk, nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesirable compounds listed in clinical studies, grouped by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing incidence of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100; &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-sweat, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, lightheadedness, excessive dog-ger, changes of vision, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will be missed to continuously change the injection area within the injection area, resulting in lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucoagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous injection of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucosamine injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal muscle and fat) and inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous GA- be of insulin ulisin the action occurs faster and the working time is shorter than with a hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin ulisin showed a proportional glucose-lowering effect in therapeutically relevant dosing range of 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a lower proportional increase in the glucoseslowering effect, just like the human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast response to normal human insulin and achieves full glucoseslowering effect about 2 hours earlier than acting insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin ulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a similar post-prandial glycaemic control is reached, like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">After eating insulin in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with a human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 midi nuds before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin given 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before starting the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
