package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , by making these easier available .
for more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions , refer to the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Wi@@ zard ... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that if you have additional software installed , you may need more modules on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on the Options tab . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if present .
the View Filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Tools View filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ os , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in plot@@ ting ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ maps allow representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; mirrors the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . hence , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you can be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap image is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can determine if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles should be used ( whereby , therefore , representation errors may occur due to restrictions in the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) .
in case of display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . there will be frames in order to prevent the ne@@ sting of entries , and this framework will need space for the frame to be lost if the rect@@ angle is square .
as spl@@ itting the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation is left to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created which are as quad@@ r@@ atic as possible . the best methods in this are rows , columns or recur@@ sive double @-@ division .
you can design@@ ate the minimal area for an entry via the menu item View View on the area . instead , a diamond pattern will be drawn into the surface of the assigned entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a child under parent .
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the picture gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Picture Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the Photo Gallery module , a dialog opens which allows you to set the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sub@@ titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect with your digital camera and can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; -@@ albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and card reader supported by your operating system is digi@@ ti@@ zed ; working together .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use it to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plugin interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ cam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens to search for .
like everyone &amp; k@@ de ; Progra@@ ms is also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , they should report problems and possibilities of improvement .
whenever you are in the program , the Help Menu includes an entry problems or wishes . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; then we would like to encourage you to reply to other users &apos; mailing list . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful of this language .
you can also learn the digi@@ cam ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ cam ; to learn .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ cam ; to participate , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to log in in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
when you start editing ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter a path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data retri@@ eval will be saved . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; edited ; will also use as an old library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains pictures as base folder . &amp; edited ; view any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will change . while browsing the folders , you will get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ cam ; requires recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folder . this can be ex@@ ited &amp; edited by inser@@ ting a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ders have no photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can be in &amp; digi@@ cam ; your digital camera set up . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Statisti@@ cs to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can &amp; digi@@ cam ; possibly also handle it . support is based on li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help shell support menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h @-@ Workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect with your digital camera and can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; -@@ albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and card reader supported by your operating system is digi@@ ti@@ zed ; working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
digi@@ cam ; used the Photo@@ 2 program for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers across the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be compiled with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not see thumb@@ nails or the creation might be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things in &amp; digi@@ cam ; is how simple its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plugin interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ cam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , and digi@@ cam ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ cam ; self perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the al@@ b tree , above the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only limitation is that an image cannot store in keywords , data list , or searching .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most popular : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . in this way , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame works only if the symbol view is displayed . which fields are shown you can configure in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos that are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the al@@ b properties or after the date when the album was first created . the date can be changed in the features of the album .
in case you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to share information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you set is used to sort your photos when you select After collection from the tool@@ bar or view albums after collection . if you want to add or remove new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums after date sorting .
buttons El@@ der , Me@@ an , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . for this purpose first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder .
if you first record an album &amp; quot ; Open , the first image in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ve@@ quot ; this will help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to choose another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the contex@@ tual menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album can only be contained in a collection and collections can &apos;t be ne@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list in the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album will be shown in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait for a moment while thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid using this in the menu Tools all preview images .
information about each image is displayed below the preview . what information is this , you can change the settings edited ; set up the albums page and customize the preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows , which appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest for a moment about a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such help window .
photos are all about &amp; digi@@ cam ; go . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can reach all the features that edited ; you have the choice between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... select . in the editing pane ; image editing you will find a guide on how to edit your photos . with the image processing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ cam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the contex@@ tual menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File type sub@@ menu . to do this , and how to adapt it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , problems can be encountered with the image containing the image . some programs do not store this data with you when you save the modified image . this will result in loss of information from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can click the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you remove a photo &amp; digi@@ cam ; Del@@ ete , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; edited ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the data view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . as a result , you can perfectly organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ve@@ quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the tags are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . also , the keywords are re @-@ imported when losing the database as soon as &amp; digi@@ cam ; the pictures notice .
you can add new keywords by clicking on the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ set of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting del@@ e@@ tion . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and lay there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and editing the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to make use of functionality with keywords , you first have to include your photos with keywords . this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; My keyword quot ; My keyword quot ; click on the previ@@ ews of the images and select keyword assign@@ ing from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords to it assigned keywords . in this way , you can use a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window while previ@@ ew@@ ing the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Rem@@ ove From the Tags menu . the menu will show you only the keywords associated with the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a tim@@ ed adjustable hist@@ ogra@@ m of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved using this hist@@ ogra@@ m . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which gives the time unit .
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more in the future .
next to the search box is a small lamp the green will be when the search finds hits . if you click here , the filter will be er@@ ased and all pictures will be shown again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criteria . after you have been saved it appears filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search is done . the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you only have to select the corresponding entry in my search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select search editing , the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you choose to edit as an advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you can find more rules for the search . see the section The tool for Advanced search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu Search .
the Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ cam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Store . all rules will be added and deleted by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group added or deleted . furthermore , you can create searches of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the lesser the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar . if you move a picture from somewhere across the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand paint sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the right pictures . here too , a threshold can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out of the mouse wheel using the mouse wheel . move it while you push the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides a lumin@@ escent in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The light table add from the contex@@ tual menu . the selection will be added to the light@@ box and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras lumin@@ escent .
from the preview pane you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and drop it there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you sync preview from the tool@@ bar and perform Zoo or slide operations on one of the images , then they are also executed in the other picture .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures . if you navigate directly from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same . now , use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the left . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal delete actions work directly from the lumin@@ escent as e.g. F@@ 4 File Edi@@ ting ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the lighting table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in turn @-@ in function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swing the visible area of the image , you need to click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode Pre@@ view , both images will show the same image area .
zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom control under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you &apos;re in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - away from the modem ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos leads through a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect , and use photos . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ cam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , backing , classi@@ fying , inde@@ xing , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management increases , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is based on your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no longer to find a specific photo without stock management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not &amp; digi@@ cam ; . the approach to save the metadata both in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure contrary to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location , unless you were in one year several times the same place . the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you do enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements , such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend the option to save metadata in the editing page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ cam ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change it ? editing &amp; editing ; giving them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real job begins , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos when you work on the next job .
now let &apos;s use keywords , keywords , as you frequently name in other programs , or continue to categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ cam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ cam ; updated while it tracks the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very coarse representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful panoramic view of the beach . if you look at it closer you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images . if you export your pictures in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your wishes into the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the time before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are already countless and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic details . this then shows the photos at the recording location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ cam ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here , which you provide the picture to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this metadata embedded in the image . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire here . these kinds of losses are the same as can happen in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section concerns problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics about the reasons for data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled carefully and you can &apos;t trust them for more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discs and good recording devices and store them in the correct way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliably .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors , even if you just have just written them . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CD and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50@@ GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ oc@@ ated format . also , read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
Disk@@ Manufac@@ turers maintain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers guarantee a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives .
in short : discs hold the longest if you are operated in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperature corrections , the error rate increases dramatically . some errors detected by S@@ MA@@ RT declare the imminent failure . this is especially read errors and swap counters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electric devices do not matter much , it looks different with devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es may cause scrat@@ ched key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and ends the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in strip .
if you choose an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also be aware that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since over@@ voltage every cable can be used on your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers also include over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . some models allow them to work even further until the current runs out . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security with electricity disrup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can integrate it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software .
they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your images in full resolution online .
the web solutions are very safe from the point of view of data backup . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies is a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all trans@@ missions are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about this is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these interrup@@ tions remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data track than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of fla@@ ws a year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for both Linux and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the broad@@ cast@@ ed file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are moving towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even though this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ated . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by data loss every year . therefore , backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before making any dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes a lot locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget the airplane crash : fire , water , electricity , children and the@@ fts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the entire house .
therefore disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference Backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time that such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync will only copy the difference between files that have actually been changed .
secure important images directly after saving them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
themes : metadata , stored IP@@ TC data , memory associated X@@ MP files , original memory , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way than to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should already be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . in * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was recognized by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted resident / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source , res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will become easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GI@@ F . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression .
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . it manages high @-@ quality images , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG Das Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provide D@@ NG and we hope that using Canon and Nikon will use it sometime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; resource resource block quot ; -@@ technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is an extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ ls@@ quot ; stored which stands for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . however , X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can turn into problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file and as noted above , the raw format is old . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compliant online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work in architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to gain widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera screen , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with digi@@ cam , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off from other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ cam ; in the section adding a photo to an album you can add a description as you can add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol are displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Met@@ ric metadata displays the internal metadata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ cam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos to your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; . while downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we suggest you check if the photos were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , you can download the download button and then select Sel@@ ected . the selected button can be downloaded until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not been digi@@ ti@@ zed until now . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded .
the list of existing albums is shown , like normal folder , displayed . you can read the list of the existing albums in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Clear All Del@@ ete button . if you only want to delete some , you must select them first and then delete selected deleted ones .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check that the photos were successfully downloaded in a digi@@ cam ; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera . if you want to remove the camera qui@@ ver completely , you should do so by the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras often do not use especially meaningful names for the photos . the file names are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you upload photos of different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and the time the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically .
the options Dur@@ ing the commit , three further options which are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ al section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can , for example , use the Pre@@ fix Photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn off the date &amp; time option . for more adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option Camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case if you download it . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ cam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window the next time .
digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
auto rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t provide this information , it lets &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced tab and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken , it can &amp; digi@@ cam ; use this to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ folder . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a section , you can find out what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case edited &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option . use the Advanced button and select the option Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , it asks &amp; digi@@ cam ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and width gra@@ ds and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural firms and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser displaying the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; edited ; users who want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that there are many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and card references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . there are at least three ways to achieve this .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the geographic allocation module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script working with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the in@@ signia of ha@@ iry coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; try to give you so much control over its work sequences as possible . there are many settings which change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; change . to access these settings , you need to change in the Settings menu ; set up . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .

this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line : this field should include the professional designation of the photographer . this can be names such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , it must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture other &amp; quot ; an@@ offer quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the digi@@ cam base ; this metadata is also available in other programs and can be edited ; imported without being lost .
save cap@@ tions as embedded let@@ tering ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; edited ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ cam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the brightness of &amp; digi@@ cam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the illuminated table , these settings are turned on if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when using image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed parts of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are defined here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
with P@@ NG setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value to a high compression .
comp@@ ress the TI@@ FF files with the option TI@@ FF files . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on the image quality since the default algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
with the option of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy option , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ cam , image processing was only an image viewer for photos . at present it is rapidly evolving into a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing .
the default view is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . this option records the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned @-@ in , because of the inability of your camera to catch the pointed @-@ lights , as a continuous white . use the setting colors creates some unusual results since it shows the top lights in various ro@@ at@@ balls . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ cam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the re@@ construct option , you will get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can be done later in the editing options of the digi@@ cam ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the demo vo@@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that have many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
and D@@ cra@@ w makes three alternatives available : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ated Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it produces but color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for correction of color , since it is performed during the conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ cam ; information such as the color information from a color space to translate in the other are therefore the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / Start color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity &amp; quot ; standard source ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color ton@@ er mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate just how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models from Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the finish : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a set of &amp; node ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface can &amp; digi@@ cam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be downloaded by &amp; digi@@ cam ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks executed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features on the left hand show a list of all the cameras currently supported . on the right side there is a button auto detection , which attempts to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the picture display mode .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you insert your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s C@@ ameras . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Display in the tr@@ ash bin , you can edit &amp; digi@@ cam ; when you delete a photo in an album , you will find further details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be used in silence by &amp; digi@@ cam ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without any questions , otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes .
they can also be edited by &amp; digi@@ cam &apos;s welcome screen . this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
the Start From Start to new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ cam ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ cam ; . if something is deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ cam ; you , if it is to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ cam ; you will find more information on this tutorial in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on previ@@ ew@@ ing an image or by the contex@@ tual menu of preview and selection of the item View / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ cam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting the image processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window displaying file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should make a copy of your image before changing it . you can do this using File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button from the File menu or button Rest@@ ore the image processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you will then loose any change you have carried out on the photo since the last saving .
almost every image processing action can be revers@@ ed or restored . you can rever@@ t the last action by selecting Edit Un@@ do and Rest@@ ore , by selecting Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and remember C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the return button or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture , or the entries in the menu file . if you made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter in the photo and zoom in by using C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can view it in the editing dialog by &amp; digi@@ cam ; change it . you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window . see the section for setting image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File Image menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture previ@@ ews can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select print wi@@ zard from the Album Ex@@ porter . if you follow the wi@@ zard , you only need to make your choice .
the digi@@ cam ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available , without the navigation arrows , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicks on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
in the cap@@ tion view , you can enter or paste labels with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields to be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are de@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after comm@@ enting it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
next to the application button , there is a button Read More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the rating section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars to the side bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the rating from the side bar is always applied to one image . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key word tree and a drop @-@ down box that was previously edited in this &amp; edited ; -@@ session applied keywords .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword . you can restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering key words in a series of pictures . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the keyword ( IP@@ TC ) keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the image highlighted and not the entire selection , if you want to add a keyword , please read the section stit@@ ch filter .
the keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their Album , - Date , keyword and search views is used . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and place it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is written on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialogue asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off in different settings .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it would have to be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , set an Advanced search across all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I was mainly edited and edited ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colours that come from your camera or scanner provide a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner , and that the colours you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you can get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
your only other image issues are via e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and do you have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB balance in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About the RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB means that your monitor is on s@@ RGB . if you work as in the color space of s@@ RGB , then you have to color your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Balance , Automatic Balance and Con@@ trast Incre@@ ase from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ t Automatic correction attempt automatic from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the brightness values across the entire image so that the dark@@ est dot is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . it sometimes produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic matching : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogra@@ m range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ usti@@ fication of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ cam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photograph .
the white balance correction is a bit limited by working on a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target picture . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , then click on the sub@@ window .
the target photo thumb@@ nail has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
at the top right there is a hist@@ ogra@@ m shown dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow alignment lets you improve or di@@ gest the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the controls above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the color if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in white balance . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ads buttons do exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also produce another photo than your original . if you save these , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats .
this tool gives the same dialog as to the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide to using color profiles can consult the chapter color management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under Color ton@@ ing Cor@@ rection . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , allowing you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and therefore you always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the color effects include four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that arose when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completes the development of the image . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this processes the ( 2 ) . the intensity applied is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large pictures the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . in this case , too , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the Simp@@ le Leu@@ k@@ thickness / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma , the tool ton@@ er correction is located to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slide for the purpose outlined here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , active channel or selected area . under the graph three slides are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and to take care of how the image changes .
on the right , the original and the thumb@@ nail of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically using the settings of the image . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogra@@ m is displayed using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top one for the dark tones , the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ boards can be used in preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright sounds . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to modify the output values inter@@ actively as in the input ratings . the compression of the output values can be used , for example , to create a hidden image as background while something else is visible in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sunny tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image preview to set the entry values of the hist@@ ogra@@ m for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Option over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of adjustment of the entries applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half the original and the target picture will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows to specify the channel to be changed from the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera , linear mode is usually the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a cur@@ v@@ ard to the right , i.e. the bright sounds , you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels appear darker .
a red marker is visible on the preview of the original picture . if you want to change this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line appears on the curve depicting the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you have created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Option over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this means you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun be@@ eps were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ cam track bl@@ ender ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change color shades of the image .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are down@@ right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will keep the general brightness as well , as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the far@@ brau@@ schen .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save and then load any mixer setting for later . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Option over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ anz option is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating about your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black and white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure using a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure using a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
aton : generates warm bright and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ aded tones . this is very similar to the process of lasting a pressure and the re@@ development in an epi@@ ph@@ ate . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ pi@@ a .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of an observer in the boundaries of a photograph is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , adjust the desired frame type for your image . the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , ed@@ ged it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a clo@@ d effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target picture decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio previously used .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this also goes to multiple places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you choose for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK button &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tool template you can lay a template over a picture .
the menu image templates use in image processing can be used to lay sten@@ cils via a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you must take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the template , simply send an email in English to the &amp; edited ; mail@@ ing@@ list edited @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set up your template folder with the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
once the root folder has been set to the templates , a tree view appears which reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the template of templates .
beneath the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces gra@@ iny images , especially in dark areas .
blur@@ r mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it does not shar@@ pen any bit , it works rather psycho@@ dynamic . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process needs to merge with only minimal differences to a color point . this , in turn , makes sharp edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras typically require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG pictures often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a sharpen@@ ing filter already while reading the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with sharpen@@ ing sharp@@ ness . you can invo@@ ke the Cor@@ ts Focus menu entry .
but you should be careful with this because the results do not work very natural : the sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image intensi@@ fies the tool . you can focus on more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing . use the tool to sign soft characters with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ ble sof@@ tener and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values frequently produce good results and should be tried out first . increasing the radius or viewing ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the blu@@ r mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will create near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image added to the original . thus , the strength of sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft altern@@ ation between tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore beauty fla@@ ws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image that ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted de@@ ple@@ tion filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused quot ; in which it revers@@ es the focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ r mask .
in practice , the circular posture works much better than the pal@@ atal folds . the pal@@ atal cle@@ av@@ age has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result from the source pix@@ el@@ ae , which are far from the original tor@@ so . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding is affected even very strongly from the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures the default value should yield 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very poor .
sharp@@ ness : this is the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring Gau@@ ß &apos; is . this is most commonly caused by a previously executed blur@@ r filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value non@@ zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
die size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the die can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos; sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try all tri@@ mming , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but will later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ ring mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienn@@ ese filter one can show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the blur@@ r mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in handling small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused outcome is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smoo@@ thing smoo@@ th@@ ies the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the color ink allows an appropriate color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set it here .
the image error correction Tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gr@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en , France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to make the restoration easier . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoo@@ thing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is subsequently necessary .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 smoo@@ thes in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD imaging will generate a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ then &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ y. p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . put this value matching to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it smoo@@ thes . this is necessary when very much noise is present , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is gone through . usually 1 or 2 suff@@ ices .
angle range &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles generate a long term . thus , you should be able to select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the quantity of quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to be om@@ itted .
the buttons Save As and Lo@@ ad make exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and result in a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the break @-@ off button .
below you can see how to remove image errors with Small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see , there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act that was caused by a poor film shift during the trip . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot at the top shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be removed successfully with this tool .
below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur@@ red the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : determines the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel distance to the front of the filter to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details cannot be preserved and noise or black@@ ening occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise tips can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we advise you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we advise you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more rau@@ cous , but also merg@@ es the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter @-@ damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this .
save on and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all noise reduction parameters you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than one image to shar@@ pen . use tool to sign soft characters with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ ble sof@@ tener and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture corrections . the texture mapping is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save As and Lo@@ ad make this exactly . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and get a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
below you can reduce as a photo with uniform noise reduced .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , textures can be reduced to an old color photograph that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by scanner illumination and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by the copyright of Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by the copyright of Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ zard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels . these will be highlighted in the preview preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark picture directly afterwards to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wi@@ zard will remember the last dark image and automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on preview and filter results . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure applied . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ cam ; vi@@ gn@@ etting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , often cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ectable quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which may possibly increase the necessary sh@@ utter speed so that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , since blur@@ red effects are otherwise caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and the color and / or gray scale of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ Filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applies the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ Filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or accidentally a light intensity of 2 , reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
brightness , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ators only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / G@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the correction of vi@@ gn@@ etting to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sph@@ erical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but flat@@ ters at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost .
general : this value controls the magnitude of distortion of the second degree . with negative values , distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth count . this value acts more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter general .
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
ligh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the t@@ onal or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . it is best to perform this correction as the first one . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect is apparent in the wrong direction .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to see the dotted lines . move it to an important place , like e.g. the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ form tri@@ mming from image processing or over the zoom regul@@ ators of this dialog .
for most pictures the barrel @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from the front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film from the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is reachable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . add the option to merge film grain if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes ink duc@@ ts to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter ect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a sort of aura in the top lights .
the digi@@ cam ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix big silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special gallery @-@ like , road @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the standard value is , although often higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity equ@@ als ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ cam ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large pictures .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon cap . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ cam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ cam ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows adjusting the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ tions . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave Mas@@ ks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted by a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Infin@@ ite : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance @-@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to res@@ ign in the background .
blur@@ red : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : taken from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening : blur@@ red the image soft in the dark and strongly in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sh@@ ear@@ ing blur@@ red : blur@@ red the image by random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
smart In@@ sp@@ ection : finds the paint tank in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ p on your image . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small pictures . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirr@@ oring or turning into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu Trans@@ form Dre@@ aming / Trans@@ form mirrors .
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you retrieve the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select the transformation size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog appears below .
change the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Foto arose was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
retain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it smoo@@ thes . this is necessary when very much noise is present , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save As and Lo@@ ad are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ all@@ ying for the photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
blowing your photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and get a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo blowing by enlar@@ ging a small picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
editing a photograph is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ rated tool to compile a picture . to cut a photo you need to create with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog is preserved .
in the tool Ac@@ cor@@ ding to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross format of the width is always assigned .
cutting the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
cutting the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings will be displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image .
the settings of the merge help make it possible to fade in , so that you can better assemble your images . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonic tri@@ angles are a way of sharing a rect@@ angle in the same harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful .
the gold division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the gold division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden centre .
the golden centre provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the gold spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition takes the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye links into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the gold spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can cause a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ ont@@ ally mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the lines can be invisible . this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
if you do a photo then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available at the right of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Trans@@ form tri@@ mming from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the automatic cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a little after the turn . but notice the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are carried out at a point of reference to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right of the dialog , you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is gre@@ ased a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with transforming tri@@ mming from the image processing .
the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal sc@@ aling , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the picture is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can cut horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , like the sea , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is blur@@ red a little . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two insul@@ ations produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming tri@@ mming from image processing .
digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write picture formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . but you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
digi@@ cam ; displays only files in formats that know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension in the list is listed , the digi@@ cam file is displayed . you can change this list of file extensions , and change it . in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you even to select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; edited ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images . redundant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful hints in English . you can convert raw format pictures to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter by &amp; digi@@ cam ; in the Con@@ figuration section you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
digi@@ cam ; supports the loading of raw footage only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is in &amp; digi@@ cam ; all supporting cameras can be viewed at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page .
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ cam ; does not understand these formats and will preview movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ cam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start the program to play .
go forward to the previously visited record in the Chron@@ ic@@ le . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .

if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the white balance module .
many tools you need to do the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ cam ; included . your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft marks , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , Un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform type of dialog displaying the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applying quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area .
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal divided without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left part shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper part shows the original and the lower part shows the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to view the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are provided by EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out of the mouse wheel using the mouse wheel . move it while you push the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the P@@ allets supplied by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either to the entire system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Hei@@ ght C@@ ursor is enabled under the color button , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used along with the actions copying , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be added as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs ; programs that contain &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are according to the program author out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; -@@ Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program .
&amp; k@@ Graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; to . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphs ; in a &amp; makes ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 knots and one h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; C@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representing the graphs . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . in the beginning , when you start &amp; ch@@ ord@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; red dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without any special keys , left and right with pressed and old ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the downloaded file was changed from another program , the following window appears :
you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings C@@ ord@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
if you open a Graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally viewer ; open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; ch@@ ord@@ viewer ; instance , or to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the Set@@ ting dialog afterwards .
at program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save and change later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on a page should be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with one on multiple pages divided graph@@ ene without head@@ line and with another font
the Renew@@ al Download page gives the ability to specify behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time .
opening the page opens the possibility to specify the behavior of a graph viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ diagrams inter@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which appears normally at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithm . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered displays of directional graphs . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for inde@@ xed graphs . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing- spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ fied graphs . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circular way according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command that is then run by a shell . the command should accept the Graph@@ ite file as parameters , and give the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms specific options , or also change the graph with a filter before being drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ rounded ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ interrupted graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse poin@@ ter , click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ item to get more help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; C@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tools to display . it needs the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; in the Settings menu you can find more options .
the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid network in which you draw the icon .
creates a new icon . if the current file has been changed , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon is to be created by a template , or whether you want to restart from scratch .

the K@@ IP@@ I module loading images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . for this to work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
when you open the menu item images , a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default setting duc@@ tile option to select your image accordingly . watch the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the Scan button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner .
make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button scan you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image will appear . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . you also need to specify the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image file .
you can create screen shots after you have selected in the menu Im@@ porting &gt; Screen Picture ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen fot@@ o@@ des :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop read only the window under the mouse is read .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been taken , the dialog box options appear with the options described above .

if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed in size before up@@ loading . size is taken from the value entered by Maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery ex@@ port@@ ant currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sph@@ erical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ ati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the top @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears then . to allow a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that were taken at the same places as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
the setting for the maximum time vari@@ ance indicates a higher devi@@ ation for the GPS period and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one place for pictures , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set up with the shown map . select the respective region and enlarge it . select this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script used to use the exi@@ ft@@ ool to attach a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right hand side will quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will appear . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default viewer , eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ,
the tab record defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with Other Color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , it also affects file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the tab model allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press C@@ anc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation process . the web browser is automatically started in order to view the preview of the gallery . press C@@ locks to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it was developed for quick visual display and quick access to its functions .
after startup , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor does not currently have any documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list for the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy from the main program and then call the Import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this feature does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please check exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coder module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that should be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can start creating the module via Extras MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images selected by you are then listed among image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to return the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds which will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high but very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension as soon as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go quickly or quietly and enjoy the slide show when you are back .
if an indication appears that codes or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings right below .
the Print Assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gim@@ p image processing . this is , for example , useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p Module directly .
this K@@ IP@@ I module allows you to import / convert your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : expect d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter Window appears in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG Con@@ version can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your images frequently or otherwise use it elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a memory format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is saved in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can cancel the conversion .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can scale or enlarge the image . to do so , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tionally ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed by this option .
press preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images via the button Add images . for the last selected image , a preview will appear on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to be sent .
click the images to remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the images , you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just need to add the addresses and the subject .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will have to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted under the los@@ s@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image file format and the original JPEG format files are , then the original files will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all the pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL option option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file name option indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option will ensure that the presentation will be displayed in a loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c .
the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the images in the album .
the time interval between the images can be placed between the images . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the pictures sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on you .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and the next image and stop the slide show .
on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date currently has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop .
this module puts the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your desktop desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse with &amp; photo@@ album ; browse through these , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , now in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords are present .
in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images .
when you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the pictures shown on which both persons are to be seen . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to view images next to the name , select the button which is located on the right outside of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image is to be displayed for each individual . in order to do this , you need to open the image preview window ( described in more detail ) and in the context menu , you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you access the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog at once .
if you enter a string in the let@@ tering or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched by this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. , 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all images by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; photo@@ album ; and watch the fast entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview page ) and in addition , the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only see pictures of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described , which you can create via the menu File ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Pur@@ pose . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description containing the HTML file later . on photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select to create a &amp; photo@@ album ; export file which is to be seen on the overview page . you can find more information about the export files in .
last but not least , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information being displayed to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that all images are exported . therefore , you can not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any more images , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings section , you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and next time automatically added . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE @-@ supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy them to it . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that have just been described have changed all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; coming together , you may want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have already spent a lot of time to fill in the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you need to do with &amp; photo@@ album ; this work does not even happen again .
with &amp; photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file itself or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by using HTML @-@ export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
when you switch to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most pictures have already been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option on this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File import ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the im@@ porting assistant consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import pictures should be copied .
it can be that you associate the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called by your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported will be imported and which categories they correspond in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : when you see pictures , you often want to navigate within different picture groups . for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your images , over ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program to manage your pictures . it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup using a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copying to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; photo@@ album ; notices the folder in which your images are saved and will use it automatically in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo@@ album ; so you can start another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Pre@@ ferences k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings .
on the left , you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and one click on the desired option .
it describes how you can design@@ ate different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can view the dialog used to process existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. set all members of a group at once in a group instead of explaining all groups of a member as explained .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ C@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
the modules can be accessed via the module . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are shared by several applications together , it can be that the modules were tested with &amp; photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own images &amp; photo@@ album ; demo database can be either accessed via command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell me I would not have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications arran@@ ges their pictures in albums : an album is simply a folder . also if &amp; photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order after albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
simul@@ ating &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview right now .
next to the current album &amp; photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category presents an album for the module .
or it will use the category that you have specified in the preferences dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category People , you will receive &amp; photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you have selected people to view and pass on this module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you can search your picture database . currently , it does not contain much information as you do not have any information about your pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the picture has been taken , etc . you can either use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these remarks when using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view of three lists with a text box , you can specify individuals , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by moving the used names up , find the people faster and assign them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the icon for sorting by date below the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the thumb@@ nail and back buttons , which are located at the top right of the picture .
if you have added multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all of these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that this is an over@@ lap , a special icon will be displayed .
in the context menu of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can simply drag an entry to a category and drop it there to make this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog by clicking and moving the boxes that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window pane .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which gives you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also fade out a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then window / fade out . see this process in the picture .
if you select the following image in the browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you have not set a filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will appear in the image viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ o@@ ving button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; photo@@ album ; namely images also use without saving you on the hard disk . of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere , with it &amp; photo@@ album ; you can record the view of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures from which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nails are available for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that &amp; photo@@ album ; you can view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into . &amp; photo@@ album ; do not support it until now to ask you to insert the relevant CD . therefore , if you are in trouble , how to avoid the mess of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those which you want to make available to others and click on Current View in the Privacy menu .
this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry to lock pictures , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other hand can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection is only used to resist those associated with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar looking at private images .
the reason why you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them sometime . for this reason has &amp; photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from previ@@ ew@@ ing as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows , of course , the picture , but additional all the information you enter via the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the information box on the top part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here on the browser , see the appropriate entries for this . so if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how frequently it loads a new image can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer of &amp; photo@@ album ; is it to be able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch back to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can drag in the image and zoom . to zoom , you can simply pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus button , you can zoom out The Plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ation key , the zoom sets the zo@@ oms , so each pixel on the screen is equal to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work with videos are that in and out are zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
with the turning functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this does not work for videos . you can make comments to the current picture with the menu item Notes from the context menu .
when you view images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the picture and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features as you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set any features on your images , these will be available to you in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply click all on a note . this is described . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you are displaying categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you are allowed &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . you can undo your painted later .
in order to complete the painting mode of &amp; photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the contex@@ tual menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is shown in yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object already selected , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position on which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop down menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to see these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with ab@@ ort .
if you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already includes the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview of the property view .
press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thus changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a view@@ ability level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the screen to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views over each other , drag the tap into the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card @-@ card @-@ tra@@ der in the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , pull the tap on the desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the cham@@ fer strip .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer strip . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of view . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place .
the current window view can be saved with View Window Order ... Save . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ dering icon The icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene rendering .
a render mode meets the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you like , from a quick preview to full @-@ quality images .
if you click on The render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View mode View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you detect the properties of the mode .
in the map file size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image cut to render into the input fields .
in the combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel , various errors may arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , compu@@ te and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split up again and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ itation depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values is exceeded the specified threshold , both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the defined threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to generate noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch on j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly quit , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; Import content , select the menu entry file Im@@ porting ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full scope of commands of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this will add the source text of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on the Help tab , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your document and the version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example , altitude data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type designation .
you can set the object size of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you tick high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
if you tick the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you tick the floor , a ground beneath the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more exact information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mod@@ i section .
on this page , you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window arrangement section , it explains how to create and save window orders .
the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the Rem@@ ove button .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a card map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will often need to use these menus and icons , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wireless model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the results of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the button or press the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see here the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert Fin@@ der Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; in fact offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly or En@@ ter button . in the object tree , the new name will be immediately displayed .
the wire model view also indicates the level , even at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the level expands to the horizon .
you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose a shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ item . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the Pre@@ view button you will see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matt black material , because you still need to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you do not see a color on the header and the sphere in the preview , just click the App@@ ly button and then preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the object tree you need to enter the color list . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose mon@@ ochro@@ me each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should be able to carry out this step by simply because you have already understood the principle working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or button user ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground since you have moved the floor around one unit down .
of course , rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the next step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the bottom , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as shown in the screen@@ shots below and click App@@ ly or press the input button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already results in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even when metal is not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea about what options you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender Method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered is a few light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ ted command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing call@@ back .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify or add commands .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the setup - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the way of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , then the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full@@ screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when you exit the name of the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show here ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ Photos ; is a &amp; cade ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributes its part to make at least problems and possible improvements .

&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ Photo ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ screen@@ . however , you can ask yourself questions about other users soon . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful of this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ screen@@ .@@ To participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photos ; .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; try to give you so much control over his work sequences as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ screen@@ . to access these settings , you need to set settings in the Settings show@@ picture ; You can change the settings dialog in 8 pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ wise you should contrast the colors with what you want to display . exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ Photo ; has a side bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; gu@@ inea ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes it easier to scan and save images .
&amp; gu@@ inea ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes as images to scan and save . &amp; channel ; can open a dialog for each image to save or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; gu@@ inea ; with the command chan@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for the selection of the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ inea ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not address these options particularly .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the full preview fits into the window .
if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving , the image will be saved and li@@ ly will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be checked .
this setting allows you to select the type as &amp; gu@@ inea ; images can be selected . dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; channel ; this is automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save As option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image will get a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that will be uploaded each time a picture is saved . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t will be used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; gu@@ in@@ ite ; -@@ Hand@@ book . the button About starts the K@@ DE over -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; gu@@ inea ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; gu@@ inea ; .

&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these abbrevi@@ ations and their function . the global short@@ cut can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and selecting Glob@@ ale short@@ cuts ... selecting the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands ... select .
you can set up any existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they work as &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; short commands . this makes your keyboard an &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Am@@ aro@@ k has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is designed to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function might look like :
Am@@ aro@@ k supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Am@@ aro@@ k has some command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script is not running .
in require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error Error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required required for this script .
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange data with Am@@ aro@@ k and control Am@@ aro@@ k . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here an example in Python :
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the installation dialog . to save and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Am@@ aro@@ k implements the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now be called &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can query more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume indicates a change in the volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Get the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add an entry you can use the d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; terminated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to perform tasks such as storing data or configuration settings .
Am@@ aro@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the cap@@ tion amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can load it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wi@@ ki script side of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de apps , you should use the category Am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly simple to use .
with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds .
you may have a number of play@@ lists , but you can never decide which to listen to ? then , the play@@ lists browser is the right one for you . and if the decision is still difficult , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music based on certain criteria .
Am@@ aro@@ k has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . this and many other useful functions make Am@@ aro@@ k the most advanced audio player .
usually you have to enter the following to compile and install Am@@ aro@@ k in the basic folder of the Am@@ aro@@ k sources :
da &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any problems while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies have to be met so that they can be used . for details , see the System Pre@@ conditions section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without effort on the furnishing dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; .
in addition , the Player window will turn off the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the Play@@ list window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
save mood files from the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the location of the relevant music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ le / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists at the end of the playlist , save the current playlist automatically when you &apos;re running &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you &apos;re going .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved .
to make the current piece visible when changing the piece , the play@@ lists window will pop up / un@@ roll to keep the running piece always in the visible window pane .
changing to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; by selecting Custom Writ@@ ings , the otherwise gray represented section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . press select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color selection enabled below for foreground and background color .
resume playing at the start means that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; after the program start , resume play automatically with the play at the place it has been stopped at the last stop .
set up the On @-@ Screen Display window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD in order to select the text in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option of custom@@ izing the O@@ SD colors for font and background . one click on the color areas opens the dialog box to select colors . if your own colors are not enabled , the default colors will be used .
the input field display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering the plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the flash@@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still enable additional settings in this card card .
the Map Collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively search sub @-@ folders : this causes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k to search for music both the crossed and their sub @-@ folders .
monitoring changes : allows &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , a incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another set is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; under Calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations concerning the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send completed pieces and to update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
access similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters will be called to the played piece . note : you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Am@@ aro@@ k needs only the package k@@ deli@@ b and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ b installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ b minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD prec@@ ede that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ escal@@ top@@ .org , so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will support for example . we try to support Am@@ aro@@ k on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by running in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
mostly this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is somewhat mature .
make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if Z &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k were compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the email will automatically open when you crash ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GM &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl @-@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easy to fix . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ an@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Am@@ aro@@ k uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can check this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ o@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Am@@ aro@@ k will find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ code in the # Am@@ aro@@ k channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Am@@ aro@@ k itself .
after the start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , only a blank playlist will appear .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the startup sub@@ window has been converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under Tools Statisti@@ cs .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Am@@ aro@@ k 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the list column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column display . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Am@@ aro@@ k is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then click on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from playlist removed from the drop down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s as simple as : - )
in the playlist of the playlist , just next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is located . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar below Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the real question must be What media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much each imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer may even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default does not include any MP3 de@@ co@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat , mp3 , input button
restart the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different hint ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure the ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , I &apos;ll crash &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; off . why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop Am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download fre@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run in the G@@ Stre@@ amer Modul @-@ folder , once as system administrator and once as your normal user .
please report to us under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Am@@ aro@@ k @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and I think the name sounds good .
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run : d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command leaves &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before going to bed , then you are wo@@ ken by the soft sounds of the music you have stopped prior to going to bed .
how to edit the current in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; running titles when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ts and titles of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ . Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button introduces a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ?
click on the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME lies on a NFS drive . after the startup of Am@@ aro@@ k the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Am@@ aro@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the Audio CD in the menu . a file browser opens with multiple folders . for normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , you can take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escape string ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically , this adju@@ sts the previous rating with a decreasing value , based on how often the play was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . there , you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and Edit : select review or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog metadata .
the developers do not want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Am@@ aro@@ k . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan which is not to be put together with Am@@ aro@@ k &apos;s short @-@ term plan .
this is a new feature in Am@@ aro@@ k , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing , anim@@ ating in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Am@@ aro@@ k ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance Con@@ text @-@ Browser design , click New Design Inst@@ all ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k while browsing in the kon@@ quer@@ or . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the button Settings ( the top ) and select &quot; Add Am@@ aro@@ k &quot; in the drop @-@ down menu .
audio cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audio cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA then please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of bug reports .
presumably &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you must &amp; AM@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably use a distribution that is installing the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same is true for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I receive the bug G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Am@@ aro@@ k .
I hold the error message There is no element present to act the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed .
you will receive the There is no element present to act the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run the system administrator register . then restart Am@@ aro@@ k .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Am@@ aro@@ k ?
setting up Am@@ aro@@ k ... Audio output you enter the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ minus { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the Set@@ ting dialog box of x@@ ine now insert the us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check in sound card supports m@@ map .
we &apos;re sorry , but the audio issue with Arts is not further cared for . you may naturally like to take this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed car@@ egi@@ ver for arts : )
listening to music should be very simple ! for this reason there is the setup wi@@ zard , which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . if you want to upgrade your collection later or simply don &apos;t like the wi@@ zard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; in a few minutes .
the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier to search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection , and you have enabled the playlist to import , then you are already in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select an audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD plays in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the Play button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have different options for burning a CD .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . also , some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , it also has &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; a player window with the most important functions .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player Window is your one @-@ click &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . at the top of the window is a scroll bar displaying the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the Player Window contains a selection of Audio Analy@@ zers , also under the Text Display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fied window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also included under the drive text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set the equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play @-@ position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ der to set the play position or volume . with playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous play .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own default settings .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you tick the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
playlist by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that don &apos;t exist in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
the Play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right hand is the playlist itself .
the context browser displays various information regarding the running piece . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail . they provide information about the current piece to different aspects .
if you have already used previous versions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , you may notice that the sub@@ windows start off . the information shown here has now been distributed in other parts of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . furthermore , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras Statisti@@ cs ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and besides a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current play . you see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover pictures in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng will be supported . the context browser will also display cover images that have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played right away .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the contex@@ tual menu .
the last section , the artist &apos;s albums , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will fold up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing right away . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the Text sub@@ window , the downloaded song is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is yet running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Artist - group@@ ing only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres will be dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below will be a further distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing artist / year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are sorted first by genre and , among them by artist .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , it might take a while .
there is a search filter directly under the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . you can find hints for using this filter in the section on the playlist in this manual .
there are several time windows available , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . you can also choose your complete collection , which makes the filter practically shut off .
by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - This will empty the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to playlist - Jo@@ ints the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function will insert the selected pieces into the queue . this will then be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Jo@@ ining the pieces into the queue for transferring to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / Bur@@ n to CD - D@@ ue the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not shown .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialogue for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files in the tr@@ ash@@ boxes ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation , select the selected album as a compilation , and it appears under various interpre@@ ters .
up@@ lift compilation selection - Change a record selected as a compilation album back into a normal album . afterwards , the album will not be displayed anymore by various interpre@@ ters but again under the interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played yet .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used to connect &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title out of the playlist and let them fall on the list artist . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . as a result , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the commit is complete stop &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; and release the drive attachment for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you will find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can pick music from a entered URL . if , for example , tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files by simply dropping can be difficult . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
the playlist contains all pieces attached to you for playing . you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter letters there will be only the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter del@@ im@@ ited search terms by spaces , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k will search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter a two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the OR keywords , search for entries containing either one or the other search term . for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two OR three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field does , but not for entries like Mike Old@@ field .
for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can set the order sequence of entries by holding the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some of the functions of the playlist . on the left hand side you will find the Add feature that lets you add pieces to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the centre of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , bigger analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ her rate can be set with one click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window on the right mouse button . you can set up the configuration via this menu .
there are many more buttons available for tool@@ bars , such as playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and selecting tool@@ bars there ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . in addition , the status for random mode and repeat can be changed simply by double clicking with the mouse in the respective display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . you can reach the settings of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k via this menu .
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information to &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can launch them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left @-@ hand side .
with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select :
the queue management received your big move into &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ set ( details about setting up these later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( earlier : audio sc@@ assem@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double click the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window , or click with the right mouse button on you , and then select Lo@@ ad . this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of random@@ ly mix and playlist mix instantly fill out your playlist and you can start playing directly . the play@@ lists Recommen@@ ded pieces start with a blank playlist and you need to add at least one piece to your collection . the suggested pieces will be added at the next piece of play , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . via the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the New Fil@@ l button emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds new pieces in the dynamic mode . edit playlist will open the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings .
with right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit . after that , the dialog opens to edit the play@@ lists settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for coming pieces will be ignored and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while setting pla@@ ym@@ ate pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each play . if you set more than 1 here , then the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick several play@@ lists , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you have played .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by running the script and then click on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k scripts , by clicking on script . it will open a selection dialog , in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .

this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when re@@ encoding to MP3 , you will get a worse quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created from a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog window you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog box that looks like this :
this dialog window allows you to track the progress of the copy process . once you read the original image in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .

O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio encoding and handling of audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ 1 decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .

norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save under will be displayed , with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is supposed to happen . you can then choose between saving and making changes .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will prompt you for any un@@ saved project what is to happen , just as if you were called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , it is asked what is supposed to happen , as if you had called File Cho@@ ices .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the dialog window . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is the ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . it promp@@ ts &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is more likely to be used for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this feature will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files will remain in the project .
open the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD that you can then burn sometime later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD which you can then burn sometime later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will delete the contents completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously by pressing the burning button .
a previously lit DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window typically appears after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used single @-@ standing . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is selected , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the table view is enabled , their contents will be shown in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the table view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , as long as a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view .
the head@@ bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ bar has no real function , it only looks nice and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window for changing the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard allocation accordingly .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wi@@ zard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this you need system administrator rights , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wi@@ zard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work straight away . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ Interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so it is more of your taste and type of task , which the contributing programs give you the preference .
in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions that all have common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ting DVD and other features for creating new projects .
void copy@@ mur@@ al ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void Screen@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which can only be used on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String )
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
I / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / home / tru@@ eg / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audio creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; audio creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many en@@ coder that encoding these WAV files ( comp@@ ressing ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default . additional en@@ co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary to compile anything themselves . however , only the en@@ co@@ ders need to be installed , which are needed . if for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to coding , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoids the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanism of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD will be explained on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step , for example , there are more information on how to use this program , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
if the CD@@ DB request of the CD data starts in accordance with the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be made . )
starts reading and - when an en@@ coder in the tab settings tab was configured in the setup directory - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection with another en@@ coder can be read as the default . it is important to note that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the Settings dialog tab .
opens the file manager so that an already @-@ read file is selected to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as logs , pic@@ s ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main direction dialog from &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ co@@ ders ) . here , you must go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes audio quality , en@@ co@@ ders and compression rates and helps you to choose the right en@@ coder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psych@@ o @-@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG might have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but this bit rate makes the difference less important , since both codes produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ devices is present .
MP3 - when music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see the &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression ratio up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression ratio about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression ratio about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo equipment .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched by the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / needed with &amp; k@@ audio creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the en@@ coder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the coding guides explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; to add titles to keywords when encoding MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wi@@ zard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the computer . it is important to note that only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( with the translator : this meant the author ) bin not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from being har@@ med by the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ ash@@ creator ; is actively to choose a check box ( Send a address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the one in the system . in this kind of configuration , it appears , the email address when retri@@ eving the data from the server is not used ( this can only know the progra@@ mmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval from &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used ; if you want to know more , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not been done yet .
to save the read WAV files , the en@@ coder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the en@@ coder . other codes can be added on this tab .
the coding package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined codes . more information about en@@ co@@ ders can be found in the section Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a coding , you can obtain more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed en@@ coder .
this can have many causes . check the device of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio en@@ coder of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; read out . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine as it is considered to be not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write per@@ missions on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; audio creator ; something that is likely to be done only once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each release &amp; CD .
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with each reading of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found once .
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card General Settings . there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only with incomplete information you will be able to select , so that you will be informed if data is missing for creating keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both items . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; record found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; renamed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is more than 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first one .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the computers . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings of the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number simultaneously displayed : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so try it yourself .
CD ; after reading out the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , you can specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be fli@@ pped to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi@@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously en@@ coded wa@@ v files : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just have the basic set @-@ up of &amp; audio creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; use . if you chose the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD takes place on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was set up in the previous section and set up .
since we use a &amp; CD which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; enter data manually instead of retri@@ eving them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , consult the FAQ section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
note : if the &amp; CD has been successfully retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the songs are already filled in and the artist &apos;s name and album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window in , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you did not select the check box for the automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a composition with various artists for each piece .
the comment field can be used for individual comments . the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
note : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; audio creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help of the en@@ coder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the out@@ going CD ; in this example , this is not important since we do not provide the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
note : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the BO@@ M .
note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line turns the selection of the piece into or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All Pi@@ ec@@ es button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if you click on the selection process to start reading the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what &apos;s going on .
click on the tab order to switch to the order window . it is in the left top half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read out on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will be displayed if you are trying to work with a co@@ dec you haven &apos;t already installed . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we &apos;ve entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the MP3 format . this allows reading and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding . with powerful machines , the result is unclear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem at the simultaneous reading and encoding ( however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is in the queue of the coding . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the en@@ coder of your choice .
&amp; audio creator ; today is maintained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS is part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is intended for people comp@@ iling from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many different options . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hi , still reading ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as to how it should go on from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ; in the drive ) , or from the unusually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot keep this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; if you want to add or change anything useful , please leave this section and agree with this proposal .
strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player by &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke re@@ modelling of lyrics , he also has some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with varying color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop to drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .@@ k@@ mid automatically determines the process used .
session support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ Window will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry Ab@@ play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ Window . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and driving with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ graph and adjust the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar , such as a pressure on the break button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , interrup@@ ts playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and again other both . some pieces don &apos;t have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song uses , so you don &apos;t have to manually set the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select the text events and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summ@@ ari@@ ze . these will be played in the row . in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ise .... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired amount in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . there , again , the file dialog , with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then add the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the pop @-@ up sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next Song button , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back to a song , select the button forecast piece , the entry Pre@@ ve item from the menu item or press the key arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when you leave &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer compreh@@ ends .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that transforms all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always allows a trumpet to sound if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need any MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as you wish . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can provide in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
in this section , you will see how General MIDI Pat@@ ches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) that sounds similar to a ri@@ fle .
so if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , with which each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as is their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key maps are mainly used to depic@@ t sounds on the percussion channel . take a look at the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channels , just do it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map with the name Name for this channel is used . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
if a pitch Ben@@ der event sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this will be converted to the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pres@@ umes that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played right now .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to show the played sounds . in the View menu , select Settings from the channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
agree , so supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding it to a collection , turn off automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , I encourage myself to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you want to make me simply happy , write to me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really enjoy it if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all of which send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone for it . I would like to point out that I only need to keep programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
thank you also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pep@@ per , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error message or even a supporting email .
and of course , my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you must compile and k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it will run as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for and k@@ app@@ name ; has not yet been finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Per@@ sist@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; up @-@ to @-@ date pieces &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you need to select play@@ lists from the same menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions may only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; S@@ ME ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ ME / Ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end @-@ animation , so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; content : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / Corpor@@ ates ; In the Invent@@ ory of &amp; KM@@ Player ; are included in the tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; KM@@ Player .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog from &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the console tool@@ bar in the S@@ MB tool@@ bar . here is an indication of mp@@ layer output .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a flash is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the set @-@ up dialog .
the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
so that a given back@@ end is always taken for a certain Mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , it must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; S@@ ME Player ; can play from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked up , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be used . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , S@@ KM@@ Player uses various names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source , intro@@ version , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ anners , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ db source . if enabled , start playing the playlist .
is there any clu@@ es how to make my CD@@ ROM drive more quiet if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be done as root after inser@@ ting the device , making sure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is used to compile and create boxes .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to fall back on the package &amp; text ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; installation should be included in the documentation of the distribution / installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact should be made through the box ; -@@ website .
if you have any questions or if you want to compile it , please contact us on the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Desktop for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; makes ; and to learn its possibilities the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for lat@@ ex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( English . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros may be used . a less sophisticated but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here is only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for it . um &amp; lat@@ ex ; you should be able to control correctly , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size can be specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start Wi@@ zard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; selecting the wi@@ zard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers a number of options for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this article describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ PET &#93; , film &#91; more amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be chosen ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ ons for lat@@ ex ; for the integration they have to be selected only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the creation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it &apos;s just a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; a simple problem search is possible ( example ) : if you see greater areas of a green text on the screen , it is with great probability that any mathematical environment has not been closed .
when setting up a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le , an empty line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) will be created with automatic processing of the surroundings ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu setting ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allow the document to be sub@@ divided into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ section the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective object .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files , the back search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; device independent file ) is created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the back @-@ search , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and once on an element in the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked , the exact opposite of it . as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source code , you jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project settings .
express : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be over@@ wa@@ amed for the ren@@ ders and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , you should see the three large selection fields . the selection fields have been developed for fast inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for the quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector For further items such as tags , notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : this command creates a name for one section , a picture or a different element .
cover : used for reference to a defined term ( sel@@ ectable via a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector ) .
when using quote , a drop @-@ down list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files corresponding editors are necessary . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written by hand .
the last drop @-@ down sel@@ ector named Gra@@ y e is used for defining the font size . you can specify the font size for the main text , the notes notes etc . there are the following fon@@ ts available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; there are two choices available : 1 . the wi@@ zard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12 pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
as soon as the source code above has to be entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or button quick assembly .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling .
if the compilation of the document fails , it should be searched in the logging after the errors . if you use rapid build @-@ ups &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size e 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } allows the change of the font size within the environment .
the changes will only be over@@ hau@@ led within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many ways to obtain the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , it can be added to certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , itali@@ c pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for the itali@@ c pressure and is valid until it is closed with an \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
after the background for writing the source code was presented with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le is now followed .
as soon as a little text has been entered in the wi@@ zard , a few adjustments may be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , a quote , a few passages in bold and itali@@ c pressure and a poem are to be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor using editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ ée ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , you can print the document by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI , file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source code was created , the conversion into desired other formats can start using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the search result allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . for this purpose , only Modern can be set up under Settings box ... tools are selected .
in order to execute the preliminary search , the mouse cur@@ sor has to be positioned in a row of the source text and then cli@@ cked to the search request . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is then performed .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Docum@@ ent the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Docum@@ ent of &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and skip to the corresponding line .
if there is a mistake in using the quick construction of the &amp; DVI , there may be an error . if there is an error , it will be summ@@ arized in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file er@@ ases the source code in the source code . in the editor , then the buttons of Pre@@ ferences La@@ Te@@ X errors and patches of La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for errors between the errors . the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears .
once you click on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template you want to use for the document . the pres@@ et options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wi@@ zard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
¤ u@@ fi@@ ge users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be open or a new file needs to be created .
when creating a new document from a file New , some strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings boxes ... settings General set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are being replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wi@@ zard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , the template can then be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . an easy way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the ability of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Po@@ sters ; can be done in the menu Tools directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; makes ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very handy &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be inv@@ oked above the menu La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; and their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l button to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking the \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with a left left mouse button , the selected text will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search and highlight different types of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many wi@@ z@@ ards can add additional snap @-@ marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entries do make a jump to the nearest or last jump @-@ mark . this is also highlighted by this jumping @-@ mark , so that it is automatically deleted at the first entry of a sign .
editing is probably one of the key aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offers excellent possibilities , have been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source tex@@ tes added . &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Sel@@ ection , the following commands are included in the text selection :
specify a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning is not meant to include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also wi@@ lt &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a back @-@ line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description to Edit Sel@@ ection paragraph .
it has been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for further commands under editing surroundings for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is above or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command will close the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing surroundings .
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly clip .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ led bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many ne@@ sted welded groups @-@ brackets you can quickly lose the overview over . this command completes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; the character is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the character is used for two simple instructions . also for the end of the guide the sign &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and has two binding quotes for lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic add @-@ on for the double attraction sign can be set up in the Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
it can also be used for country @-@ specific settings ( e.g. , german or French ) and thus German or French add @-@ on characters . many other languages are available .
when using Shift ; En@@ ter En@@ ter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item .
within a table environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ is terminated with an ending line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; try to do this . while using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the nearest tab in the above line . although this tab is not necessary , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offers good source @-@ code completion , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; three modes are built @-@ in . three of them work on demand and the other two are designed for automatic processing . all these modes can be set up for different working methods in the Settings box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set .
start a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last character of the input will be removed and , as a result , the list is enlarged . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are then removed from the selection of a command . alternatively you can add boun@@ ce marks , so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing ho@@ cks nests , and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
in the Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Compl@@ et@@ ely adjustments can be made to these lists . you can select different mart@@ y@@ rs for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as wi@@ pes for the common language use .
the command mode is not useful for completing environments . there are always a few characters to be entered with \ \ begin and calling the execution mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are often used to provide a special mode for completing environments .
when calling the Compl@@ et@@ eness Mode on the Men@@ Ã ¼ Edit Los@@ s@@ able Environment or the C@@ key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the ambient execution can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button it can be stopped .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; box recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be inserted .
in Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; En@@ able settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter List of the Noti@@ fication Mode for tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up in the Settings box ... boxes can be set up ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the file L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is initiated by the menu Edit Ver@@ full@@ filled abbrevi@@ ation or the C@@ tr@@ l + Alt key button , the character L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
great W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic processing . however , it has been found that many wi@@ pers are written more than once in a document .
this mode can be set up in the menu Settings box ... Let boxes be switched off . here , the t@@ res@@ hold can also be specified for displaying completion .
the processing files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog shapes the inser@@ tion of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are compiled in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ating comp@@ iling , Cre@@ ating conversion and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be seen in the standard viewer using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called to compile it . if no viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is about the project New Project .... The following information for the project is being asked :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ e@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows execution of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be found in other versions of the API .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a rather sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tual ; they are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather a complete user guide for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application textile doc@@ t@@ k containing a database with all documents and a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
a double click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

&amp; sig . is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . using the command @-@ line interface , you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures there will be any signature from the signature file of &amp; sig . through many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; sig will be read for the whole day . for each day you will use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . thus you get an empty signature ; in the signatures tab . click with the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; on the &amp; lt ; empty signatures ; and add to the bottom section of your new signature .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then Rem@@ ove from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the tool@@ bar .
in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button and enter the new short selection by pressing the key or key combination .
to use &amp; k@@ gs ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use com@@ bos as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it one piece , we give it a graphic interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application is waiting for a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the selected working folder , let the current working folder be checked . if not , remove the selection of current working folders and enter the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time my pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the currently opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , just select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to output on the screen , your file is defective . please check the reported error and try again .
if the file to be checked already marks in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply checked . if not , delete the tick with the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the file well @-@ Form@@ ed is , click the Well @-@ Form Check option .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; with Defini@@ tions UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema and for the Relax@@ NG examination is the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also an &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus should be selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection .
specify the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , that are called &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we will begin editing the Edit Plugins section . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all included plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for un@@ ambig@@ uous identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold when you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for more information on notes .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific occurs within the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone was working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Settings dialog can create , edit and delete events .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
to enter comments is simple . either the remark entry can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by ann@@ ot@@ ation text .
in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with nick@@ name of the set nick@@ name of the team member , is part of the project from the following possibilities : team leader , Sub@@ project Manager After the area and sub@@ project leaders , the respective area or sub @-@ project names should be given , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages are supported .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be modified there@@ with . the entries are :
big / Low @-@ write of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal cap@@ itali@@ zation means the attributes are inserted in such a way as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags automatically include : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
do not automatically include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
start and finish date automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accent@@ ed characters into the corresponding code during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ e types for det@@ ecting different types of files . by using the Standard button , the default settings can be restored .
standard sign encoding : the encoding of newly created files or in other ways than with file opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) . but this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the chosen DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface has passed through changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning messages range is used to control the display of aler@@ ts by hook @-@ up of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of / V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode . regarding the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser knots in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of node in the tree , which is to be opened automatically when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be automatically opened . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are the ones where no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are group@@ ed in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s may be valid , divided . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the clause abbrevi@@ ation is something different than in a group for Jav@@ ascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plu@@ gins are K@@ Part applications from the third page , which can be re@@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the most known and kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
loading component in the &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load the load . only @-@ read @-@ k@@ Plus@@ Parts usually refuse charging if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , then save the entry if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely newly developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ u@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug @-@ in concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a view in which all holding points are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to be taken care of .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ Gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or stops listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the View de@@ bu@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug request has started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will proceed . if it happens before a request has been made , the execution will begin as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the Deb@@ u@@ gger runs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include in it is corrected .
instruc@@ t the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next one as if there were no current .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this chapter describes how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can help to become better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility make &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbolic links of image kno@@ bs ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , 1 &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , den &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insert of tags into a document without a risk of a write failure .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but one element type above itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when used it is used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( family 2 only )
valid for class class only . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute set and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags describing how this attribute should be shown &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source texts used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will not cause a leg termination , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check takes place only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file there is a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D Editor DT@@ D settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = default 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be created with settings actions ... created . clicking New action will lead to the same dialog :
the short@@ cut abbrevi@@ ation assigned to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : global script folder : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process replaces . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is fla@@ gged to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be received ; in the input box input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input .
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written on the standard output ; error messages , based on the standard error output . it can be specified , what should be done with the text written on the default output , by setting the value of the selection field :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker .
once a tool@@ bar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it , activate dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; if available so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ am ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size other .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
in view that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be interpreted as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol will be inserted ; start@@ les ; -@@ Tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the action you want .
select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue using other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar dialog using settings tool@@ bars . make sure the required tool@@ bar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by vali@@ dating all symbols to ensure that everything works .
backup to the right folder . after New XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please customize your &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . this is why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html tag 1 = day 1.@@ html tag 2 = day 2.@@ html tag 3 = day 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; Docum@@ entation like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # off Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit to the depth of the box ( except the reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out for yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view ) .
spaces affect nothing , but make sure to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resour@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eien .
the content section is the range of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to design context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script to display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( contex@@ tual list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of text @-@ separated contex@@ tual elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you won &apos;t get rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the disk resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places , there is an e @-@ mail menu entry like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where everyone else &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . in order to make a significant contribution we recommend to sign the resources , for which it requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have several keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can stay empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , tested &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signi@@ fication . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag XML format . there is a simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can start from menu DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which is to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Definition line : the string that will appear in ! Doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d to appear
fine setting of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand them and gain full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; everything that is considered global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that they can only be used in person .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are em@@ ailed in the project &apos;s folder tree , which em@@ o@@ g@@ lows common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construc@@ tional views , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the right mouse button in order to obtain a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all card leaders , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , skip to book@@ marks or exec@@ uting CVS commands to the current document .
rect@@ angle in the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / past@@ ing / past@@ ing ) , editing the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click on the icon that represents the tag . now , you can enter the data for this recently added tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the Bau@@ man@@ insights ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the representation with card @-@ guides are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building views .
project Management is a powerful tool that gives &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows administrators to manage the files in the project using the right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; It is open to all possibilities .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . more templates are available .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by the right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree opens .
this tree appears among the other tree @-@ views . with it , it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system geared to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two guides at the bottom of the window where the information can be accessed : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems starting with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ DE ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same is for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for a quick web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost impossible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way affiliated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or help@@ full help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there , converts special characters to the &amp; html ; -@@ S@@ ign so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts text from cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s first line to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script releases error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
turning and turning the problem re@@ porter at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to place book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents are group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
creates a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows for example to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded other input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manage the project . you will find details in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be added using settings actions ... or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars by clicking on the tool@@ bars .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
upload an &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities of the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refresh@@ ed without updating the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE directory , the loading fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current Tag Settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insert of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is denied the inser@@ tion by tool bar when this day contradic@@ ts the rules in this place .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in activ@@ ates it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the posters ; version .
select the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; with the external application ti@@ dy .
instant change between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or cause in@@ significant graphics . the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ windows mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will influence any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which you can add and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the mouse poin@@ ter environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled out from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling out the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file is filled out automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in case of ser@@ ver@@ sive scripts ( e.g. , PHP , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is re@@ started from scratch , no hooks .
this option displays all files and folders within the folder and you can make an accurate selection according to the code .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded to the menu tree in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this way the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by atta@@ ching its own tree view to each profile .
in the sub@@ windows Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre@@ defined event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details .
by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced at this time .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the menu Projects or the Symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files finds . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project management view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the context menu on the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only more one profile exists , the button is da@@ zz@@ led to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten at the end of the program . this option is useful when frequent upload of files is needed and the rather uns@@ afe password stored on the disk option is not available .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high load profiles can be created and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can not be read easily , but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project , i.e. by simply rotating the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the project tool@@ bar menu or project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with whom one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best stack@@ ed through the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is discussed below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions can be executed like tool@@ bars , ren@@ aming tool@@ bars or setting tool bars , which can be specified , which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and set settings for actions .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . you can copy , move , or link any directory existing to the system in the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you set for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special documents are placed in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es work in a corresponding way to be efficient .
these templates are useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl @-@ based .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; html ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate ....
once this is done , note that ( although stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
binary templates are simple : just copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used to drag and drop , or paste over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files , and select a site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is secured in the project folder , but of course it can be stored in the same way as local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ insert head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynamically combine with &amp; PHP ; create , insert or link files with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / tmp and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder , and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a sel@@ ector dialog with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when par@@ ental attribute is inher@@ ently cont@@ ested .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set so , it would be explicitly enabled in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or provided text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders , copying and past@@ ing templates from one location to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back if needed to the source code editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit , the source text editor is still required . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is active and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , the key has the active cur@@ sor from one window to the other , while the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and source text editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically , the time span can be set .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so you can choose the document properties . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created .
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. , keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons down . a click into the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cur@@ sor is the same as in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . the marker works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the back button or button .
past@@ ing tags is done in the same way across tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it is important to note that past@@ ing tags is not removed before , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the tables wi@@ zard or the lists wi@@ zard are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style sheets can be tra@@ cked .
to compile and compile the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already available for a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
support in a template , at a point in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db Com@@ pati@@ bility Mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a file name without path@@ name . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g If for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement is verified with a ple@@ a named my@@ QNA@@ ME or a given model name . &amp; eg ; template is consistent with any my@@ QNA@@ ME containing the template text string .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be added ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a required holding point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line serial number . this is automatically done when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll through the arrow keys on / off through the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the previously executed commands .
several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument a holding point is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation . another progra@@ mmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned and k@@ nu@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two persons independently work on one piece of code and make changes . the merge editor among the differences windows allows to resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; helps you to merge and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; in the merge @-@ merge :
&amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and comp@@ lies with the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check frequently , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
cor@@ di@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folders
the Open Di@@ alogue allows you to manually type fil@@ en@@ ames , select the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open Di@@ alogue opens up your selection and displays them again next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences is done with two files .
by clicking the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparing or merging of folders will be initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C a folder , then use &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when merging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not essential to immediately specify an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the setting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting to merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the break button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d first need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; only drop text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging of text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these default settings can be changed using the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one can see at the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merging ) well to see .
in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comment@@ aries , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line of broken lines is dotted dotted .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the title output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the button S@@ prin@@ ge to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump to the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merging or manual editing ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no row in the queue . this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in any mark you may copy and paste .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . proceed cau@@ ti@@ ously with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate primarily with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , side ab , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are also used by other programs .
in the default window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ out@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the marker to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ paste ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and no manual copying . be careful with this option , because you could accidentally over@@ ride the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the new@@ lines of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not with binary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the run and restored at the next start ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides font with variable width to select , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen font does not support this representation nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered rendered . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically insert an un@@ just color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab sign will be inserted .
if you press or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; first , find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . even when merging , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others save only a new@@ line character , although they are different . if this option is enabled , the carriage return character will be made visible , but like a white sign . during the merge operation , this option must be disabled .
this option is disabled in default . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
look inten@@ sely for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( pres@@ et is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflict in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are covered in the chapter for scanning of folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation of the directory comparison and merging .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
a short notice of what the local coding is about the selection fields for encoding appears . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding to store for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
turn this off to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this option is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just leave the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . merging the current file in the merge @-@ menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click launches the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your requirements . you can use this function e.g. for cutting troubles@@ ome parts or correc@@ ting the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .

$ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line deriv@@ atives . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so it is almost deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements from each other . for example :
instead sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for the display and to merge . the other operations only change the data that the line algorithm al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m looks like .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often , programm@@ ers in a folder need to edit many files . for this reason you can compare and merge complete folders in recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... perform selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , do not merge . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message panel about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that were then compared are listed .
when scanning the file is completed , shows &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left hand side , ...
each file and folder found during scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories and open all sub @-@ directories with which you can open or fold all directories .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the Details Pan@@ e to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be notified of any problems of this type again .
as shown in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
in identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries varies .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then , folders also have the same color . at folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is green , then yellow and later , when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified , and if the option synchron@@ izes directories . then select &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the necessary action to ensure that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merging and storing the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after merging copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option New File instead of merge is enabled , then check &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders can not be started .
when merging , one file is processed after the other . it shows your status column he@@ els when merging successfully , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right .
when the file comparison method is selected in the alignment dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all clas@@ h actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you don &apos;t have a target folder , then the three @-@ folder merging mode C is used as the target , while two @-@ folder merging B is selected as the target and when syn@@ cing , A and / or B is used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry , select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the er@@ ron@@ eous elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options Th@@ rough , Simulation and C@@ anc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window opens ( notice the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are done with a file , you can restart / resume directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if you click on an error , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to issue the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with merging .
if some entries have been individually merged , you can see &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them together again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 Set ... ) now has a section called directory merging with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are shown in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder specific can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hide attribute . in other file systems , a preceding poin@@ ts@@ . a file is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element @-@ tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
if the option is turned on , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : when the option is turned on , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively examined . ( note that &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; not for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is disabled in default .
the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders using a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of safety .
the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful , for example , if the change date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
enables Synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging files will be selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging the copy of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because the knowledge is presum@@ ed that the other file has not been altered too . ) This option is dis@@ connected in any case . )
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ original extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of single files , not only the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the merge view view stays visible while merging single files ; you can move the window @-@ divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views using the switch between the directory and text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file with a double click . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also directly merge a single file , without first having to merge the folder . to do so , use the function Ac@@ tual file merging from the merge menu .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # has the URL : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . there is a short list of restrictions :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or folder . then a file as a link target is always assumed . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way of editing authori@@ z@@ ations or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( please note the option familiar to the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a difference @-@ viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the contex@@ tual menu .
usually needed &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is however used as a part , it takes up &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select a Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is a compact ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that merging can be combined like the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by st@@ owed in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path or going to do it .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably not told the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure inst@@ alls in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line is considered not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the case but this is more often the case .
the editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after the text is removed , no sr@@ c is left ; no sr@@ c is left and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found in ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ nu@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Log File in the source package .
to compile and install ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have problems while comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties arise , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) Cop@@ y to the cli@@ p@@ board and cle@@ ars the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ paste ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders don &apos;t appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you must re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
this also means that identical files are not copied to the target folder when merging . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior is probably changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the A , B and C button below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already existing ) . if the lines are already present , you will be removed by clicking on the button .
this option is disabled in default . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both within a desktop as well as multiple .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual work surfaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; motion is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other work surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only contains the two entries P@@ ager ... and end@@ ings . if however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , On Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces .
when this field is crossed , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work surfaces are shown .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled together with the name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty work surfaces are displayed to allow them to be selected .
simply display simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program windows . icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications in some other windows managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work surfaces are displayed in horizontal and vertical position in a vertical row , which is very good for the representation on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or with their contents and move them . besides , it runs out of the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch settings ... lets the dialog display settings .
currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have write permission for the file , you must log in as a user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you have to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign it to this one . possible values are :

this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers , and people with visual impairment . this documentation is intended to be a complete guide to the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is lab@@ eled as a magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively you can &amp; K@@ mag ; cause a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fication window . this is also possible with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press &amp; Shift ; press or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the drop @-@ down window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window stays firm and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ Q ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the ad update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to switch to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ Q ; automatically uses your inserted short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ads ( re @-@ load the document in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , zoom , zoom , etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use a magni@@ fier area , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and any mou@@ sec@@ lick causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people suffering from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and every mouse click can em@@ ulate pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer should be caused by pain . if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not been done yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to avoid pain caused by mouse clicks , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic auxiliary agents , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement shortly .
is the intelligent pushing activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it has em@@ ulated the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the drag while pressed mouse button . the intelligent pushing requires a little practice , but you get accustomed to it quickly .
this residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; mouse @-@ click carries out .
if Intel@@ lig@@ ently Move is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 sec ) is activated . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after dropping the mouse button , wait until the mouse button is released again , if no moving of the mouse is done in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through the mouse shift . if this function is enabled , slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound appears , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten reaction time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there &apos;s a sli@@ der sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent slide should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart post@@ p@@ one .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds .
first of all , you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not result in unwanted reactions .
when your mouse is bu@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse . as this happens , mouse is different to the mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole into which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and the so@@ iling easily with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent push @-@ button in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this will reset the status of the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another position .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around tool@@ bars and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent pushing , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent pushing is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to highlight text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move when you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the text instead : at the end of the text area , press a mouse click and hold the shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when to move the move time when you move smart . later , you can use the intelligent slide even without the audi@@ ble mouse click .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter bin@@ es . this program has been developed for people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome and which causes pain in the mou@@ ths of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a certain time to start a pulling process before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can be performed with the mouse .

&amp; mouth ; is a program with which dum@@ b users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select sentences from a list with the conversation history that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wi@@ zard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text pas@@ sage@@ . from the text pas@@ sage@@ ways , you can often choose the text passages used without typing it in . the text passages can be edited , of course .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you define the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can reconci@@ le the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word supplement .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white area in the screen shot ) and a disk cache of the already spoken sets ( the upper white area in the screen shot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; set correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the disk space . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Pre@@ ferences k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , side word completion as well as the page K@@ TT@@ L voice service .
in the input field of the voice output , enter the command to enter the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the sign encoding , with the text being passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed to the language generator unchanged as default input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation of your language generator . examples of this can be found in the appen@@ di@@ x .
the kt@@ ts@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ em@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text pas@@ sage@@ way or in the box for text pas@@ sage@@ ways .
with the selection of Instant Message the selected text passage is spoken directly and in addition to the default memory inserted . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered only in the input field .
with the second drop down of the editing window for text passages , you can determine whether the text pas@@ sage@@ way should be automatically saved when closing the edit window .
with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text account book is not saved . select Before Save queries , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pas@@ sage@@ way should be saved .
the word supplement page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window , next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop @-@ down box .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Docum@@ entation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly inserted words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text pas@@ sage@@ ways are represented as a tree structure .
in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage folder , you can only change its name .
to delete actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either use the selection in the menu bar , tool@@ bar or a drop down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the default storage .
the selected text will be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected portions of the default storage .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory .
when this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default above the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
when this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when not enabled , this status bar is hidden .
when this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is by default placed above the editing pane directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
you probably did not enter the command for the speech output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General settings and enter the speech output command on the flash@@ card speech output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
festival is a speech synthes@@ izer system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ sh are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival will be installed in the / usr / local / festival .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows Free@@ T@@ TS to be used free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et directory .
for the third example , the option has to be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax sol@@ ves the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ em@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ continued voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD Language Service , which appears in the dialog box of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can let text appear on the computer . a list of already spoken phrases is stored , which the user can always re@@ write .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

before you can use it , you must install and set the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher correctly .
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card General is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; t@@ ts ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the default speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several print queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the card leader Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card holder will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
at the click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with one mouse click , and click on this button to scroll the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; t@@ ts ; -@@ system .
select a type of m@@ oods here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card board speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ons ; already use almost . go back to the General tab and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ons ; click on the map instructions to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language output system . click on the General tab in order to open this card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will display orders , and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ L will be stopped and the T@@ TS System by &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs and kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled .
when this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start , cancel , pause and resume text orders .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken over on all pages .
the card card orders only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and check language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) there .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , check the text that is to be read , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; html ; -@@ head@@ lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Po@@ sters ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first , check the text to be read , and select the text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; makes ; included in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can notify the text of this news by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up &amp; con@@ verse ; for example , set up that you are notified when in an IR@@ C channel a message appears in which your nick@@ name appears . by typing , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the menu Settings menu . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as this can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ osed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of frac@@ t@@ ts ; for normal work with kt@@ ons ; filters are not required .
text is processed in filters before it is sent to the speech speech schedule . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation in order to replace un@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and or@@ ator or to deal with certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the way they work , it is important to know how the speech &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text .
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of screen readers is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and stops the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; you can read a long text on a web page , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest is simple text orders . any order you send orders from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es except the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of these reads , this output is stopped and terminated .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be even more types of filters .
string substitute replaces parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions .
&amp; XML ; formers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ml .
with speaker selection filters , you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice on the speaker chart for example , you can read the text of K@@ DE news about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . the processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the normal filters set up . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below set @-@ up di@@ alogs will be displayed .
for set @-@ up filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily ; it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ put . the list is processed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . if you load a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button at the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter it .
the string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if the same . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . words must be limited on both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the card speaker or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is handed over to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is chosen based on the speaker properties that the program speci@@ fies , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can use it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
in order to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you are looking for . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected that meets the desired requirements most . click the button on the right to show the speaker selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your spre@@ ader settings , or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the language edition API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ L via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD by speech synthes@@ izer , means that you can use this synthes@@ izer .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice sharing services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give

none of the so @-@ called speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for Festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone for S@@ able to work at all . you &apos;ll need to do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing cat@@ fish is spent . what can I do about it ?
make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replacement filter .

speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos;s program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend it for the use of another synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages and development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you include the source code of the tar@@ ball from the source code archive or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you start typing , check first whether speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . for this you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed in such a way that speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &apos;s set @-@ up is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can return pro@@ posi@@ tional or paragraph mode , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
for example , if you have a speaker set up , whose language is English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in .
if you click Add a Spe@@ aker on Add , and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the card box for speaker setup will be displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . for details on the modules please refer to .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you only have to enter festival .
select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting will be done automatically . generally , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and show this gray , the voice you selected does not allow these settings to be selected .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ L so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after startup only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the symbol in the system section to show the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ L reads a text .
here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the spokesperson ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can pre@@ - or return spar@@ ingly in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be sc@@ aled down to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . further information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled and kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module or des@@ kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you select AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
the program so@@ x must be installed so that these settings can be implemented , so that these settings can be implemented .
click App@@ ly to apply the new settings for the current &amp; t@@ t ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of these will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in case of doubt choose Standard .
on this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed if the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message .
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of Screen Reader has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next higher priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning stops the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds and kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and screen readers &apos; messages if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ons ; read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card Noti@@ fications will appear .
select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and left ; don &apos;t read noti@@ fications .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are not read off .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are called by &amp; kt@@ ons ; ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the characteristics of the speaker you want here . default sel@@ ects the speaker that is displayed in the list on the card speaker as the top entry .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option is the action to carry , which was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All Noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the pre @-@ read noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the notification settings to a file . use the Save button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all items except All Noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to select text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of e.g. abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ml is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ml .
if the speed or pitch settings are not set to 100 % in the festival configuration dialog , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional limits filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can start typing text into individual sentences . this can be done faster with reading , since only the first set needs to be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional view filters . at the first start of the sequence , a set @-@ up filter will be set up automatically . you can change its settings or add further pro@@ posi@@ tional limits filter , but beginners will get dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the speaker selection and enter text to read . switch back the speaker selection , change some features and check how the choice of speaker is changed . of course , you need to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the reading can start , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is set up automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
syntax limit filters compare text with a regular expression for by@@ laws and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional borders ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default set limit filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( known to notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional view filter from accidentally , you can insert this again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
you can over@@ ride the speaker settings for the application on the board selection chart .
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card board speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker with all the characteristics of a speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , choose &amp; t@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , select the speaker , which is most likely to match the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the speaker you want here . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the language is before , if you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the pop @-@ up button and then use the speaker that is most likely to follow the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr stops immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get back@@ tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command of the recently registered G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , G@@ Stre@@ amer is probably a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to upgrade or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I stop a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message saying : Un@@ to open PC@@ M .
the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA appear on your system , preventing simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have downloaded an extra voice for the festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / neu@@ rop@@ int / Vo@@ ices , add the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers .
in order to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ s@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Inter@@ active provide a setting for speed on the board card for speakers . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ml ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting from &amp; html ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; html ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml re@@ forming filter , and set up the speaking speed .
I don &apos;t make it happen that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; t@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , the festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file to convert from SS@@ ml to S@@ aber is the GEN@@ DER tag . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags .
I have added an own string release filter and now I can go back or go back in &amp; kt@@ ons ; no more ways to set it forward or go back . on the map runner orders is displayed , the order consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
you must not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clam@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional pattern recognition instead .
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer , by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ops ; execute the command @-@ register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ ma@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and read a text . it also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ons , the current sentence will still be read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the microphone speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included on most and Linux ; CDs already included .
if you have downloaded and kt@@ ops ; as a tar@@ ball ( tar @-@ packed archive ) , login as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :

before you start typing , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you will need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transmission .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses stage 1.@@ 95 beta or new . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone for the voices . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions , so check the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .

festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , synthes@@ izer . then , Festival takes over le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , which generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Programme and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German text di@@ phone .
in this process additional wra@@ pper code is added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the folder Festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ -@@ package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf to show the device at all and allow setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the module network settings are loaded when the option network settings is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best meets the distribution and release date . by marking the setting of non @-@ recur@@ rent questions , the definition can be permanently hit .
changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will navigate the system administration mode at the right bottom end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der network interfaces :
the settings of the network interfaces that are displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialogue device setup .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are done at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering a already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or switched off , if required . power @-@ on of an off @-@ wired network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be enabled or switched off , if required . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain data by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the computer for the name resolution part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .@@ DNS records can be ranked by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ dered or Her@@ under in priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group host to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group Calcul@@ ator for name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display dialog edit .
the List Nam@@ ingly well @-@ known hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily during bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the List Nam@@ ingly well @-@ known hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP , which is still in the test , will replace version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add .... Add the New ali@@ ases dialog .
enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the Add button . if the known host has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known to name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog you want to edit will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient to install and k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; Co is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second section all of the commands are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf .
this section does not replace any further knowledge of IP networks . in this appen@@ di@@ x only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is communicated .
IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to per@@ severe in the near future . therefore , IP@@ v@@ 6 is currently concentrating on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point , which is available to a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ way .
for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section , you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections , so it is not surprising if in the case of active DSL connections there is another content than specified there .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar &apos;s ability for fast , selective un@@ packing . the second aim was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take to secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; disc@@ us the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the default on the tape does not , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the default , searches for the right index on your disk . if this is not found , you &apos;ll be asked if the strip index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything goes smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been incorporated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not require format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you are format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape name and capac@@ itance , continue with the format of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be saved .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so @-@ marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select the ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the test has started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files that should be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Recovery from the menu .
once the recovery process has started , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery .
when you confirm the restoration settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the tape index file on the basis of the tape content . this process cle@@ ars all existing index files for this tape . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all files listed in backup files , only the files contained in the same file system are backed up , such as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
performing an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then have been saved .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding option of the tape unit .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted the command blocks load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the throw at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the tape is released when it is released ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy @-@ Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The band id . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds preceding the era in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat folder .
the rest of the files on the tape are tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU , tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports different protocol files . in addition , it enables quick access , for example , on information about problems occurring on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files .
in addition , it enables experienced users to provide quick access to information about problems occurring on their server . therefore , it attempts to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a set of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the sy@@ slo@@ g server format and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort each protocol line of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log , first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will open . will not show you this , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not started with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log , for regular users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criteria or after entered strings . the list of the protocol lines will now be changed automatically , so that only the log lines will be displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system log , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so you show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color as protocol lines of the level hint .
if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process . this may be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter strip .
in addition , you can use the option to jump to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu , in order to display all new add @-@ on protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . as soon as you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
in addition , find the following folder : - Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when starting the system in the &amp; Linux world . it is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel first looks under / etc after an in@@ it file .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d , and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service you want to start when you boot the system or when you switch to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d .
the kernel searches for the program in@@ it at different places and starts the first one to find .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the initial area , you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you can repair it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and running the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would pause the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between levels , or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . this will not happen unless you pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . in order to only copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the contex@@ tual menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the serial number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the Sor@@ row numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different work areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it by cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually change the sort number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with standard @-@ level@@ ing and now the machine is rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using any other distribution , please check that all configuration files are provided by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without message if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to and k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation from &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made any changes , you must save them . either use the tool@@ bar icon or save the entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double @-@ click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created , where you can make individual settings . additional flash@@ cards will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD / Unix .
the password management card file appears in the case of shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , as in BSD @-@ Unix .
this card only appears if there is limited space limitation for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ i@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space restrictions are in KB :
these parameters can be individually set for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the fil@@ esystem with space limitation .
the card groups inform groups about the group members of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or selected group functions an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ loader , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
