<seg id="1">The module website can be translated in the & konqueror; menu under Extras page. select the source and target language of the translation from the opening list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated instead of the entire & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. Babelfish in the best case produces a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations are not required to make important decisions without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page by yourself, where you can insert translated text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror, by making these easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions, refer to the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & konqueror, select Settings Wizard... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings modules from the kde; addons. please note that if you have additional software installed, you may need more modules on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the Options tab. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The View Filter module (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Tools View filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in the & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentos, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists in plotting nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree-maps allow representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; mirrors the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. hence, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command you can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap image is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can determine if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (whereby, therefore, representation errors may occur due to restrictions in the sign of the Treemap).</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of display algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView this goal is not always complied with. there will be frames in order to prevent the nesting of entries, and this framework will need space for the frame to be lost if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As splitting the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries is done, the implementation is left to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses in such a way that rectangles are created which are as quadratic as possible. the best methods in this are rows, columns or recursive double-division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can designate the minimal area for an entry via the menu item View View on the area. instead, a diamond pattern will be drawn into the surface of the assigned entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a child under parent.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets designed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Picture Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Photo Gallery module, a dialog opens which allows you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the option" "" "" "" "Subtitled" "" "" "" "allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of miniatures of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the thumbnail file name of the image, specify whether the filenames will be shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation area; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu item in the & konqueror; in addition, you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the MSIE password for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser detection to access with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to connect with your digital camera and can download your photos directly in & digicam; -albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, every medium and card reader supported by your operating system is digitized; working together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicam; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use it to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image plugin interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works fully in 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion via libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like everyone & kde; Programs is also digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, they should report problems and possibilities of improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">Whenever you are in the program, the Help Menu includes an entry problems or wishes. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicam; is a project supported by a community. that means that users and developers can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digicam; then we would like to encourage you to reply to other users' mailing list. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful of this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also learn the digicam; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digicam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digicam; to participate, is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to log in in the developer mailing list by & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start editing; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter a path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data retrieval will be saved. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & edited; will also use as an old library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the topmost folder that contains pictures as base folder. & edited; view any subfolder as an album. no picture will change. while browsing the folders, you will get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digicam; requires recursively the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is iste in hidden folder. this can be exited & edited by inserting a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My Albenders have no photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can be in & digicam; your digital camera set up. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Statistics to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it can & digicam; possibly also handle it. support is based on libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help shell support menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh-Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to connect with your digital camera and can download your photos directly in & digicam; -albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, every medium and card reader supported by your operating system is digitized; working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. for the actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">Digicam; used the Photo2 program for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers across the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto 2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be compiled with libexif support so that the thumbnails can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not see thumbnails or the creation might be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things in & digicam; is how simple its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plugin interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digicam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, and digicam; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digicam; self perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the alb tree, above the horizontal separation line or into another application window. the only limitation is that an image cannot store in keywords, data list, or searching.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most popular: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. in this way, filtering on the filename works only if the symbol view is displayed. which fields are shown you can configure in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos that are edited by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the alb properties or after the date when the album was first created. the date can be changed in the features of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">In case you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan an album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to share information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you set is used to sort your photos when you select After collection from the toolbar or view albums after collection. if you want to add or remove new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums after date sorting.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons Elder, Mean, New Year: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. for this purpose first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first record an album & quot; Open, the first image in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlivequot; this will help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to choose another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the contextual menu & quot; As an album preview, select. additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "an album can only be contained in a collection and collections can't be nested." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list in the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album will be shown in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait for a moment while thumbnails are generated. you can avoid using this in the menu Tools all preview images.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the preview. what information is this, you can change the settings edited; set up the albums page and customize the preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows, which appear. if you let the mouse pointer rest for a moment about a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about & digicam; go. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can reach all the features that edited; you have the choice between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... select. in the editing pane; image editing you will find a guide on how to edit your photos. with the image processing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digicam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the contextual menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File type submenu. to do this, and how to adapt it to your needs, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, problems can be encountered with the image containing the image. some programs do not store this data with you when you save the modified image. this will result in loss of information from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can click the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 renaming from the context menu. note that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you remove a photo & digicam; Delete, it will be moved to the garbage bin of & kde; moved. F8 Photo Delete or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Delete.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & edited; uses either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the data view, so that you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. as a result, you can perfectly organize your keywords. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword livequot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The tags are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. also, the keywords are re-imported when losing the database as soon as & digicam; the pictures notice.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking on the right mouse button either on & quot; My keyword quot; or on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the subset of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting deletion. if you delete a keyword, the photo will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and lay there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and editing the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword quot;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To make use of functionality with keywords, you first have to include your photos with keywords. this can happen in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; My keyword quot; My keyword quot; click on the previews of the images and select keyword assigning from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords to it assigned keywords. in this way, you can use a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window while previewing the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove From the Tags menu. the menu will show you only the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a timed adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame, you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which gives the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the box below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box is a small lamp the green will be when the search finds hits. if you click here, the filter will be erased and all pictures will be shown again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criteria. after you have been saved it appears filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and search is done. the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching again, you only have to select the corresponding entry in my search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select search editing, the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you choose to edit as an advanced search, the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. here you can find more rules for the search. see the section The tool for Advanced search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Search in the context menu Search.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digicam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenStore. all rules will be added and deleted by operators. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group added or deleted. furthermore, you can create searches of the type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digicam; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the lesser the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar. if you move a picture from somewhere across the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left side bar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand paint sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digicam; find the right pictures. here too, a threshold can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out of the mouse wheel using the mouse wheel. move it while you push the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicam; provides a luminescent in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L The light table add from the contextual menu. the selection will be added to the lightbox and its window opened. if you are back in & digicam; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras luminescent.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview pane you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and drop it there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you sync preview from the toolbar and perform Zoo or slide operations on one of the images, then they are also executed in the other picture.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures. if you navigate directly from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same. now, use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it in the left. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal delete actions work directly from the luminescent as e.g. F4 File Editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the lighting table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section you will find a built-in turn-in function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to swing the visible area of the image, you need to click on them and hold the & LMB; in the mode Preview, both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zooming works just like in other views. just use the zoom control under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you're in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - away from the modem? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos leads through a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images, find, protect, and use photos. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the & digicam; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, backing, classifying, indexing, archiving, optimizing, waiting and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management increases, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confuses and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is based on your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need no longer to find a specific photo without stock management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use certainly not & digicam;. the approach to save the metadata both in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure contrary to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location, unless you were in one year several times the same place. the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date. if you do enough photos then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements, such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save metadata in the editing page of the metadata in & digicam; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change it? editing & editing; giving them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real job begins, as you should now assign keywords, captions and a rating to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos when you work on the next job.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's use keywords, keywords, as you frequently name in other programs, or continue to categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digicam; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digicam; updated while it tracks the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very coarse representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone know your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful panoramic view of the beach. if you look at it closer you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream, have associations, memories, the historical period of time is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of images. if you export your pictures in web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your wishes into the lettering and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the time before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are already countless and will become even more profound in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic details. this then shows the photos at the recording location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digicam; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for the author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the work description of the photographer. examples of this can be titles as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here, which you provide the picture to others. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they do not offer protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this metadata embedded in the image. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digicam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Themes: plate defects, disk failure, current violations, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, distribution superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire here. these kinds of losses are the same as can happen in traditional paper photos or negatives. this section concerns problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics about the reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled carefully and you can't trust them for more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discs and good recording devices and store them in the correct way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliably.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors, even if you just have just written them. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CD and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-propriocated format. also, read the media with a description, date & author and then store it on a clean, dark dry and protected site. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">DiskManufacturers maintain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers guarantee a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: discs hold the longest if you are operated in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperature corrections, the error rate increases dramatically. some errors detected by SMART declare the imminent failure. this is especially read errors and swap counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not matter much, it looks different with devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies may cause scratched keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and ends the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in strip.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you choose an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also be aware that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since overvoltage every cable can be used on your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected. some manufacturers also include overvoltage contactors that also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a wearable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. some models allow them to work even further until the current runs out. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security with electricity disruptions with the cost to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can integrate it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your images in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very safe from the point of view of data backup. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies is a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmissions are vulnerable to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs at least ensure the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about this is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all of these interruptions remain undetected until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data track than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of flaws a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for both Linux and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems: incorrect, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the broadcasted file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are moving towards the 10 megapixel cameras. even though this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteriorated. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone else responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by data loss every year. therefore, backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before making any dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, the exchange of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes a lot locally and destroys a lot. forget the airplane crash: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference Backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time that such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync will only copy the difference between files that have actually been changed.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after saving them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored IPTC data, memory associated XMP files, original memory, storage, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way than to make a certain vigilance. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should already be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. in * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was recognized by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resident / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source, resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, you can create it yourself. this task will become easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossfree, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (default). it manages high-quality images, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG Das Digitale Negative file format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provide DNG and we hope that using Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; resource resource block quot; -technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is an extension & quot; .xlsquot; stored which stands for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. however, XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can turn into problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file and as noted above, the raw format is old. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compliant online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work in architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to gain widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera screen, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-layered editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with digicam, then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut off from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them to web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digicam; in the section adding a photo to an album you can add a description as you can add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a fertig indicator appears at the bottom and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol are displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metric metadata displays the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of & digicam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos to your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digicam;. while downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we suggest you check if the photos were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired with the default selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, you can download the download button and then select Selected. the selected button can be downloaded until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these images have not been digitized until now. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">The list of existing albums is shown, like normal folder, displayed. you can read the list of the existing albums in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digicam; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Clear All Delete button. if you only want to delete some, you must select them first and then delete selected deleted ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should therefore carefully check that the photos were successfully downloaded in a digicam; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera. if you want to remove the camera quiver completely, you should do so by the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use especially meaningful names for the photos. the file names are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you upload photos of different recording galleries into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and the time the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the commit, three further options which are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data about the author in the Standard Autoridential section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can, for example, use the Prefix Photo -% Y-% d% H:% M:% S. turn off the date & time option. for more adjustments, you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option Camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase if you download it. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digicam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">Digicam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section page bar, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Auto rotation is normally turned on, and if your camera doesn't provide this information, it lets & digicam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced tab and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken, it can & digicam; use this to automatically download sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same subfolder. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta section, you can find out what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case edited & digicam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option. use the Advanced button and select the option Date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, it asks & digicam; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog appears for the camera. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in length and width grads and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural firms and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser displaying the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & edited; users who want to locate the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that there are many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailers and card references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. there are at least three ways to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geographic allocation module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script working with the ExifTool of Phil Harvey. it uses the insignia of hairy coordinates, which are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on Embedded Preview or Start image editing. you set the standard behavior of & digicam; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for the author's line: this field should include the professional designation of the photographer. this can be names such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture other & quot; anoffer quot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the digicam base; this metadata is also available in other programs and can be edited; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save captions as embedded lettering (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests over a file in the main window. depending on the selected option this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; edited; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The brightness of & digicam; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the illuminated table, these settings are turned on if possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can turn off the toolbar when using image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed parts of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image. these colors are defined here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Compress the TIFF files with the option TIFF files. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on the image quality since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the option of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy option, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digicam, image processing was only an image viewer for photos. at present it is rapidly evolving into a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default view is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in output. this option records the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the auto color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, i.e. the parts of your images that are burned-in, because of the inability of your camera to catch the pointed-lights, as a continuous white. use the setting colors creates some unusual results since it shows the top lights in various roatballs. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digicam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstruct option, you will get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can be done later in the editing options of the digicam; image processing. in order to keep the time for the demo voicing, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that have many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">And Dcraw makes three alternatives available: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenated Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it produces but color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for correction of color, since it is performed during the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digicam; information such as the color information from a color space to translate in the other are therefore the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / Start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity & quot; standard source; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color toner mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma doesn't correct conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate just how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models from Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the finish: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a set of & node; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface can & digicam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will be downloaded by & digicam; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks executed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper controller adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left hand show a list of all the cameras currently supported. on the right side there is a button auto detection, which attempts to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the picture display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera box. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you insert your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window's Cameras. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Display in the trash bin, you can edit & digicam; when you delete a photo in an album, you will find further details in the deletion of a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be used in silence by & digicam; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without any questions, otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">They can also be edited by & digicam's welcome screen. this accelerates under certain circumstances the start-up of & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The Start From Start to new photos is forcing & digicam; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digicam;. if something is deleted from the base folder, asks & digicam; you, if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited; used to adjust the main window to your taste. you can select these settings under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digicam; you will find more information on this tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicam; includes fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on previewing an image or by the contextual menu of preview and selection of the item View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digicam; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see Setting the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window displaying file name, current file number, magnification factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before changing it. you can do this using File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore button from the File menu or button Restore the image processing Restore in the toolbar. you will then loose any change you have carried out on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every image processing action can be reversed or restored. you can revert the last action by selecting Edit Undo and Restore, by selecting Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the return button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, picture, or the entries in the menu file. if you made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter in the photo and zoom in by using Ctrl; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, you can view it in the editing dialog by & digicam; change it. you can view it from the & digicam; main window. see the section for setting image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the File Image menu and get the default & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. whole picture previews can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select print wizard from the Album Exporter. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digicam; main window has a side bar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available, without the navigation arrows, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the caption view, you can enter or paste labels with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF and IPTC- fields to be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are deformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After commenting it, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the application button, there is a button Read More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars to the side bar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. the rating from the side bar is always applied to one image. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field Urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the key word tree and a drop-down box that was previously edited in this & edited; -session applied keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword. you can restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering key words in a series of pictures. if you have entered different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image are stored in the keyword (IPTC) keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the image highlighted and not the entire selection, if you want to add a keyword, please read the section stitch filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar with their Album, - Date, keyword and search views is used. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">Suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is written on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialogue asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off in different settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it would have to be one or more, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, set an Advanced search across all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I was mainly edited and edited; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colours that come from your camera or scanner provide a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner, and that the colours you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you can get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are via e-mail or web, where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and do you have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB balance in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About the RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to callibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor, since sRGB means that your monitor is on sRGB. if you work as in the color space of sRGB, then you have to color your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Balance, Automatic Balance and Contrast Increase from the menu Correct Automatic correction attempt automatic from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the brightness values across the entire image so that the darkest dot is black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. it sometimes produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic matching: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new jiustification of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a bit limited by working on a color space with 8-bit per color. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target picture. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The target photo thumbnail has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right there is a histogram shown dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow alignment lets you improve or digest the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the controls above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the color if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Loads buttons do exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also produce another photo than your original. if you save these, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool gives the same dialog as to the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. color-mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide to using color profiles can consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under Color toning Correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, allowing you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and therefore you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool to gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The color effects include four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that arose when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completes the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and this processes the (2). the intensity applied is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large pictures the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. in this case, too, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the Simple Leukthickness / Contrast / Gamma, the tool toner correction is located to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slide for the purpose outlined here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or selected area. under the graph three slides are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and to take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the thumbnail of the image can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically using the settings of the image. on the left-hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top one for the dark tones, the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinboards can be used in preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright sounds. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to modify the output values interactively as in the input ratings. the compression of the output values can be used, for example, to create a hidden image as background while something else is visible in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. to do so, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sunny tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image preview to set the entry values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Option overexposure indicator checks all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of adjustment of the entries applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha Channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half the original and the target picture will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows to specify the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images captured with a digital camera, linear mode is usually the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curvard to the right, i.e. the bright sounds, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels appear darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">A red marker is visible on the preview of the original picture. if you want to change this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line appears on the curve depicting the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you have created can be stored in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Option overexposure indicator checks all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this means you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun beeps were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The digicam track blender; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change color shades of the image.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left part of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are downright: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will keep the general brightness as well, as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the farbrauschen.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can save and then load any mixer setting for later. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Option overexposure indicator checks all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was readjusted. the Luminanz option is enabled. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating about your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black and white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lentil filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure using a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure using a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Aton: generates warm bright and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold in the shaded tones. this is very similar to the process of lasting a pressure and the redevelopment in an epiphate. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepia.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digicam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to see. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicam; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the boundaries of a photograph is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, adjust the desired frame type for your image. the picture with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), edged it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a clod effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target picture decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio previously used.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any place. this also goes to multiple places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. use text orientation, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you choose for your text can be changed until you press the "OK button" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicam; apply tool template you can lay a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image templates use in image processing can be used to lay stencils via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compressing (9) for the reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the template, simply send an email in English to the & edited; mailinglist edited-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set up your template folder with the base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">Once the root folder has been set to the templates, a tree view appears which reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the template of templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Beneath the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must decrease the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces grainy images, especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurr mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it does not sharpen any bit, it works rather psychodynamic. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process needs to merge with only minimal differences to a color point. this, in turn, makes sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras typically require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG pictures often have a camera internal sharpening. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpening filter already while reading the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with sharpening sharpness. you can invoke the Corts Focus menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should be careful with this because the results do not work very natural: the sharpening increases the sharpness of edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image intensifies the tool. you can focus on more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpening. use the tool to sign soft characters with the menu entry Corrigible softener and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values frequently produce good results and should be tried out first. increasing the radius or viewing amplify the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will create near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image added to the original. thus, the strength of sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft alternation between tones are excluded from sharper and therefore beauty flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image that (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digicam; tool refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted depletion filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocused quot; in which it reverses the focus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurr mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular posture works much better than the palatal folds. the palatal cleavage has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result from the source pixelae, which are far from the original torso. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß 'folding is affected even very strongly from the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very poor.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sharpness: this is the sharpness of the sharpness. use this parameter if your blurring Gauß 'is. this is most commonly caused by a previously executed blurr filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value nonzero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the die can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauss' sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but will later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp Masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurring masking a larger neighborhood used than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter one can show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the blurr mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in handling small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused outcome is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothing smoothies the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color ink allows an appropriate color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction Tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grc CNRS laboratory in Caen, France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to make the restoration easier. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is subsequently necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 smoothes in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD imaging will generate a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothen [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above ally. p then defines the relative smoothing. put this value matching to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it smoothes. this is necessary when very much noise is present, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is gone through. usually 1 or 2 suffices.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle range [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles generate a long term. thus, you should be able to select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the quantity of quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save As and Load make exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and result in a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the break-off button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with Small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artefact that was caused by a poor film shift during the trip. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot at the top shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">Below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blurred the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: determines the sharpness of the sharpness. this value sets the pixel distance to the front of the filter to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details cannot be preserved and noise or blackening occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise tips can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we advise you to change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we advise you to change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemoleranz of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more raucous, but also merges the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter-damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save on and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all noise reduction parameters you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than one image to sharpen. use tool to sign soft characters with the menu entry Corrigible softener and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture corrections. the texture mapping is performed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; arteftequot; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save As and Load make this exactly. any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and get a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with uniform noise reduced.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures can be reduced to an old color photograph that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts caused by scanner illumination and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by the copyright of Martin Dickopp. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by the copyright of Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels. these will be highlighted in the preview preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark picture directly afterwards to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on preview and filter results. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durcut: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure applied. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digicam; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, often cannot illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead & quot; vignetectable quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which may possibly increase the necessary shutter speed so that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since blurred effects are otherwise caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's film and the color and / or gray scale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter. the tool vignetting correction applies the transformation with a CenterFilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or accidentally a light intensity of 2, reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma setting: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the regulators only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want finer readjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the color gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the correction of vignetting to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect, but flatters at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grades corrects the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the magnitude of distortion of the second degree. with negative values, distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth count. this value acts more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonal or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. it is best to perform this correction as the first one. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect is apparent in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to see the dotted lines. move it to an important place, like e.g. the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Transform trimming from image processing or over the zoom regulators of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the barrel-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives, such as shots from the front, frame and paintings, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film from the GimpGuru.org website that is reachable under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). add the option to merge film grain if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes ink ducts to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter ect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a sort of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digicam; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix big silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special gallery-like, road-photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the standard value is, although often higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity equals ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digicam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digicam; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the processor is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a carbon cap. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digicam; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digicam; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows adjusting the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortions. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave Masks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted by a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurr effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Infinite: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance-sharpness: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to resign in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurred: blurred the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates blurring of a linear moving, z: B: taken from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening: blurred the image soft in the dark and strongly in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shearing blurred: blurred the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart Inspection: finds the paint tank in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make regentropp on your image. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet appearance. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small pictures. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digicam; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can move it through mirroring or turning into the right orientation. you can find the tools in the menu Transform Dreaming / Transform mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you retrieve the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select the transformation size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog appears below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Foto arose was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Retain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it smoothes. this is necessary when very much noise is present, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save As and Load are used exactly for this purpose. each stallying for the photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Blowing your photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and get a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo blowing by enlarging a small picture on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photograph is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underrated tool to compile a picture. to cut a photo you need to create with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cutting button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog is preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool According to aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the cross format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">Cutting the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings will be displayed as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the merge help make it possible to fade in, so that you can better assemble your images. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonic triangles are a way of sharing a rectangle in the same harmonious triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The gold division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the gold division in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden centre.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the gold spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition takes the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye links into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals on these lines can cause a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontally mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the lines can be invisible. this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available at the right of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transform trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the automatic cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a little after the turn. but notice the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out at a point of reference to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right of the dialog, you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is greased a little. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transforming trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. a horizontal scaling, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can cut horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, like the sea, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shearing tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is blurred a little. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two insulations produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">Digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write picture formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">Digicam; displays only files in formats that know. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of these with a predefined list. if the extension in the list is listed, the digicam file is displayed. you can change this list of file extensions, and change it. in the Configuration section, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you even to select the format to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & edited; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images. redundant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save loss-free if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the image format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful hints in English. you can convert raw format pictures to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by & digicam; in the Configuration section you will find further information about the use of modules with & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="690">Digicam; supports the loading of raw footage only with the dcraw program, which is in & digicam; all supporting cameras can be viewed at the bottom of Dave Coffin's web page.</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support recording short films. these clips are often stored in the AVI- or MPEG format. & digicam; does not understand these formats and will preview movies. if you click on a movie file & digicam; the & kde; settings for playback of movies use to start the program to play.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to do the photo editing are in & digicam; included. your description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, soft marks, noise reduction, refocusing, Unsharp masking, & etc;. use a uniform type of dialog displaying the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture applying quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical parts without duplicates. the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal divided without duplicates. the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left part shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module will be noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data are provided by EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out of the mouse wheel using the mouse wheel. move it while you push the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>

<seg id="731">Additional required software: & Cgraphiviewer; is a & kde; -program which presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for representing the graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. in the beginning, when you start & chordviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & red dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without any special keys, left and right with pressed and old; -key);</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the top-to-see dialog appears then. to allow a possible correlation of time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains of course data that were taken at the same places as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation which shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time variance indicates a higher deviation for the GPS period and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one place for pictures, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have appropriate data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then push the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location. since the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to the next, you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set up with the shown map. select the respective region and enlarge it. select this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script used to use the exiftool to attach a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.01. you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right hand side will quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image will appear. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default viewer, eg; Kuickshow,</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab record defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other Color depth, you can change the default color depth. naturally, it also affects file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab model allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation process. the web browser is automatically started in order to view the preview of the gallery. press Clocks to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rotations, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it was developed for quick visual display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After startup, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation at the moment. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor does not currently have any documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list for the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy from the main program and then call the Import function. this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This feature does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please check exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that should be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can start creating the module via Extras MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed among image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting of the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to return the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds which will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value produces very sudden, a high but very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie with the button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now go quickly or quietly and enjoy the slide show when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that codes or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button Settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The Print Assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gimp image processing. this is, for example, useful to improve or print with the Gimp Module directly.</seg>
<seg id="853">This KIPI module allows you to import / convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: expect dcraw not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter Window appears in mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG Conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your images frequently or otherwise use it elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a memory format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is saved in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can cancel the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in a previous attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can scale or enlarge the image. to do so, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportionally (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed by this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Press preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images via the button Add images. for the last selected image, a preview will appear on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Click the images to remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images, you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you just need to add the addresses and the subject.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will have to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted under the lossless formats like TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image file format and the original JPEG format files are, then the original files will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages in search of errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Slideshow, a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slide show will appear. you can choose between the selected and all the pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option will ensure that the presentation will be displayed in a loop. you can then manually interrupt it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time interval between the images can be placed between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the pictures selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn on you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous one and the next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date currently has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module puts the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your desktop desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can browse with & photoalbum; browse through these, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, now in each group, so in people, places and in the group keywords are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press with the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the pictures shown on which both persons are to be seen. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all people, places and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use & photoalbum; however, for each person to save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button which is located on the right outside of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image is to be displayed for each individual. in order to do this, you need to open the image preview window (described in more detail) and in the context menu, you can select the image for the corresponding person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you access the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog at once.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the lettering or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched by this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e., 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all images by certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & photoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & photoalbum; and watch the fast entry, screenshots and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & photoalbum; start for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; -Demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & photoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & photoalbum; as a related HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & photoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview page) and in addition, the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will only see pictures of this period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photoalbum; provides you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is in & photoalbum; integrated and the other is available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual is the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version described, which you can create via the menu File...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout and Purpose. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description containing the HTML file later. on photoalbum; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select to create a & photoalbum; export file which is to be seen on the overview page. you can find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last but not least, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information being displayed to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that all images are exported. therefore, you can not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any more images, such as a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so, it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings section, you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files, and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and next time automatically added. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE-supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you will need to manually copy them to it. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that have just been described have changed all three to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; coming together, you may want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have already spent a lot of time to fill in the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you need to do with & photoalbum; this work does not even happen again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored in the file itself or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks for the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file by using HTML-export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you switch to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy to the .kim file, copy & photoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures full size since the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File import... select, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing assistant consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you associate the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is called by your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported will be imported and which categories they correspond in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: when you see pictures, you often want to navigate within different picture groups. for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) determining the information about your images, over (2) the browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has started as a program to manage your pictures. it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup using a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copying to a disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photoalbum; notices the folder in which your images are saved and will use it automatically in future starts. if you want to read another database in & photoalbum; so you can start another folder tree with pictures, you can start & photoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: photoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Preferences kphotoalbum; set up... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of & photoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left, you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of preview and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can designate different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can view the dialog used to process existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete members groups, i.e. set all members of a group at once in a group instead of explaining all groups of a member as explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photoalbum; splits its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiCam and Gwenview. this modular system means KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the module. the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared by several applications together, it can be that the modules were tested with & photoalbum; therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own images & photoalbum; demo database can be either accessed via command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't tell me I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & photoalbum do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications arranges their pictures in albums: an album is simply a folder. also if & photoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order after albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulating & photoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all the pictures that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & photoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here is a photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category presents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category that you have specified in the preferences dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category People, you will receive & photoalbum; so do so, so if you have selected people to view and pass on this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can search your picture database. currently, it does not contain much information as you do not have any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & photoalbum; is the possibility to annotate any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the picture has been taken, etc. you can either use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if for example on all pictures Jesper is shown and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these remarks when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view of three lists with a text box, you can specify individuals, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & photoalbum; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, by moving the used names up, find the people faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click the icon for sorting by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and annotate them with annotations. in this case, simply click on the thumbnail and back buttons, which are located at the top right of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have added multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all of these images and use the menu item Several entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an overboard. to show you that this is an overlap, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the annotation dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. additionally, you can simply drag an entry to a category and drop it there to make this entry into a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the annotation dialog by clicking and moving the boxes that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which gives you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also fade out a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then window / fade out. see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the following image in the browser, you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images, or all pictures if you have not set a filter. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will appear in the image viewer. if you haven't opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview preview. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Removing button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & photoalbum; namely images also use without saving you on the hard disk. of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere, with it & photoalbum; you can record the view of & photoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures from which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. however, the thumbnails are available for the pictures 5-9, so that & photoalbum; you can view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into. & photoalbum; do not support it until now to ask you to insert the relevant CD. therefore, if you are in trouble, how to avoid the mess of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those which you want to make available to others and click on Current View in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry to lock pictures, so that all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again, click lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password change in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other hand can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this kind of password protection is only used to resist those associated with & photoalbum; not very familiar looking at private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you spend all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them sometime. for this reason has & photoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from previewing as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows, of course, the picture, but additional all the information you enter via the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the information box on the top part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere. you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here on the browser, see the appropriate entries for this. so if you click Anne Helene, the browser displays all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you would have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and picture. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as slide show. & photoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how frequently it loads a new image can be checked by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer of & photoalbum; is it to be able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch back to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can drag in the image and zoom. to zoom, you can simply pull a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button, you can zoom out The Plus button zooming in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the equation key, the zoom sets the zooms, so each pixel on the screen is equal to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work with videos are that in and out are zooming with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turning functions from the context menu, you can rotate the picture. this does not work for videos. you can make comments to the current picture with the menu item Notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you view images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view the picture and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features as you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set any features on your images, these will be available to you in your browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply click all on a note. this is described. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you are displaying categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you are allowed & photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to complete the painting mode of & photoalbum; switch on the painting from the contextual menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully proficient, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are shown in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is shown in yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an object already selected, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position on which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop down menu appears, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to see these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or discard the changes with abort.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to the & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already includes the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview of the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button, thus changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a viewability level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a view, drag the screen to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the Anfasser to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views over each other, drag the tap into the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card-card-trader in the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. in order to solve a view from the anchoring, pull the tap on the desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the chamfer strip.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfer strip. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of view. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View Window Order... Save. a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Rendering icon The icon Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode meets the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes as you like, from a quick preview to full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on The render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View mode View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you detect the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map file size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the section subsection and enter the image cut to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user's manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel, various errors may arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, compute and connect & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is split up again and adaptively because the recitation depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values is exceeded the specified threshold, both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the defined threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to generate noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch on jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; that calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; Import content, select the menu entry file Importing... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full scope of commands of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this code between the two special comments / / * PMrawBegin and / / * PMrawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this will add the source text of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the Help tab, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your document and the version. the versions 3.1g and 3.5 are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (for example, altitude data) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene folder, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used to display the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the checkpoints. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type designation.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object size of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects, such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick high detail fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you tick the wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a ground beneath the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more exact information about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window arrangement section, it explains how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop-down selector Standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all the views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and deleting selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you get a card map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often need to use these menus and icons, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit Delete. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wireless model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the results of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button or press the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you see here the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert Finder Body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; in fact offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply or Enter button. in the object tree, the new name will be immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also indicates the level, even at the moment only as a limited finite level. if you render the scene, the level expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">You will see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will only find the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizon line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first subitem. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = ground pigment), with a click on the Preview button you will see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments preview only shows a matt black material, because you still need to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see a color on the header and the sphere in the preview, just click the Apply button and then preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the object tree you need to enter the color list. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose monochrome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to carry out this step by simply because you have already understood the principle working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input button or button user), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground since you have moved the floor around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the next step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the bottom, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the screenshots below and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already results in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even when metal is not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea about what options you & kpovmodeler offers; hopefully you've learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a Render Method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is just black. obviously, every scene that should be rendered is a few light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted in this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reverted command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing callback.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting of & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the keyboard shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler; modify or add commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can view by clicking on the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image is to be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name was found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the setup - & kuickshow; there are five flashcards. in three of them, General and editing and slide show, you can set the way of & kuickshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcuts for the respective windows can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color you can set further down. default is not fullscreen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activated, loads & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder, while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay when you select the next image, and is especially suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option saves & kuickshow; when you exit the name of the last opened folder. next start opens & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the image, the background will also be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuickshow; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option, the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>

<seg id="1181">& Amarok; uses like all other programs keyboard shortcuts. below you will find a list of these abbreviations and their function. the global shortcut can be set up by right-clicking in the player window and selecting Globale shortcuts... selecting the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands... select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You can set up any existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they work as & Amarok; short commands. this makes your keyboard an & Amarok; -control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is designed to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlists and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP function might look like:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">In require 'corundum' rescue LoadError Error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required required for this script.</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, you can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow execution of external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the installation dialog. to save and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok implements the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is played. the script could now be called & zb; with DCOP functions, you can query more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume indicates a change in the volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Get the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. to add an entry you can use the dcop Amarok script addItem (submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminated, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed in order to perform tasks such as storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar) which can optionally also be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the caption amaroscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar-parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can load it to www.kde-apps.org and link to the Wiki script side of & Amarok; append. for your entry on kde apps, you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly simple to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than through endless menus. you may also search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; s collection browser and quick search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">You may have a number of playlists, but you can never decide which to listen to? then, the playlists browser is the right one for you. and if the decision is still difficult, dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music based on certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used, so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. this and many other useful functions make Amarok the most advanced audio player.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following to compile and install Amarok in the basic folder of the Amarok sources:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake use, you should not have any problems while compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of options available.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compilation options, certain dependencies have to be met so that they can be used. for details, see the System Preconditions section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without effort on the furnishing dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition, the Player window will turn off the player window in addition to the playlist. if the option is off, only the Playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use mood barometer: this function is only available if & Amarok; with support for moodle compiled. the option switches the experimental function of the mood barometer.</seg>

<seg id="1214">External browser: lets you choose which browser from & Amarok should be started when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser, which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save playlists at the end of the playlist, save the current playlist automatically when you're running & Amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist when you're going.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will be used. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To make the current piece visible when changing the piece, the playlists window will pop up / unroll to keep the running piece always in the visible window pane.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust & Amarok's appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting Custom Writings, the otherwise gray represented section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window and context browser. press select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of Custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. use the color selection enabled below for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playing at the start means that & Amarok; after the program start, resume play automatically with the play at the place it has been stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Set up the On-Screen Display window allows you to switch on the OSD. when on-screen display is attached, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the desired font for the OSD in order to select the text in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option of customizing the OSD colors for font and background. one click on the color areas opens the dialog box to select colors. if your own colors are not enabled, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The input field display text displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering the placeholders, the OSD can be adapted to your own needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users. this allows you to specify on which screen a multi-monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The flashcard audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still enable additional settings in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The Map Collection is used to set all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively search sub-folders: this causes & Amarok to search for music both the crossed and their sub-folders.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitoring changes: allows & Amarok to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, a incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folder (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, another set is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql device section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; under Calculator: will enter the host on which the MySql database is located. afterwards, the network port is entered under which the database is accessible.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The card card last.fm supports the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and if necessary create music recommendations concerning the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send completed pieces and to update the profile: this setting makes it possible & Amarok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Access similar interpreters: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list of similar interpreters will be called to the played piece. note: you can view the list in the context browser. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelib and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelib installed (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelib minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD precede that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedescaltop.org, so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will support for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by running in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org and append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is somewhat mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of the libraries used by & Amarok were compiled with the same compiler version. if Z & Amarok were compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatic. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the email will automatically open when you crash). if it is a common crash and send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print" Error in writing the tags of $ARGM [0]\ "unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s icons in the status bar (random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist) always look active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a well-known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are easy to fix. note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amaranapp: symbol lookup error: undefined icon: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. you can check this with ldd 'which amaroapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most of the installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freencode in the # Amarok channel.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please enter only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok, only a blank playlist will appear.</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want. then drag the files to the right of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the startup subwindow has been converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Tools Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the list column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the playlist of the playlist and select column display. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove, and then click on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select from playlist removed from the drop down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there just as you would do with other files. that's as simple as: -)</seg>

<seg id="1269">No. yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach so the real question must be What media types supports GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you see, we support pretty much each imaginable audio format. GStreamer may even decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">You may use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, which in default does not include any MP3 decoders (for patent reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat, mp3, input button</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the alsa sink, the device has to provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different hint (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you're looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer is reading the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Centre Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure the artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">At KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. the magnifying of the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the arts driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia complete to get the faster arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver was strongly optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to change to the GStreamer driver, I'll crash & Amarok; off. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After the installation of GStreamer, you need to register all the components. register to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>

<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, it also has & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player Window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a scroll bar displaying the current piece or current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bitrate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player Window contains a selection of Audio Analyzers, also under the Text Display. you can switch from the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnified window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also included under the drive text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window, while the EQ button is used to set the equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play-position slider. use the slider to set the play position or volume. with playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous play.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click on the EQ button in the player window. once you tick the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Playlist by & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that don't exist in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The Playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right hand is the playlist itself.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the running piece. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and artist. these three subwindows are later explained in detail. they provide information about the current piece to different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used previous versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindows start off. the information shown here has now been distributed in other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and besides a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz icon you will find more information about the current play. you see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover pictures in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png will be supported. the context browser will also display cover images that have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played right away.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, the artist's albums, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will fold up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing right away. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the Text subwindow, the downloaded song is displayed for the running piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is yet running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the song text. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Artist - grouping only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres will be disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below will be a further distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping artist / year - album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces are sorted first by genre and, among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / interpreter / album - this setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button, you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you have many pieces, it might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. you can find hints for using this filter in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">There are several time windows available, starting from the last 24 hours up to one year. you can also choose your complete collection, which makes the filter practically shut off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will empty the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Joints the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function will insert the selected pieces into the queue. this will then be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Joining the pieces into the queue for transferring to the media player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Due the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialogue for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files in the trashboxes... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">As a compilation, select the selected album as a compilation, and it appears under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Uplift compilation selection - Change a record selected as a compilation album back into a normal album. afterwards, the album will not be displayed anymore by various interpreters but again under the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for running time. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played yet.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used to connect & Amarok; for example, use your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod it must be included in / mnt / ipod.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired title out of the playlist and let them fall on the list artist. if you're done, click Apply. as a result, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. when the commit is complete stop & Amarok; and release the drive attachment for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you will find a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can pick music from a entered URL. if, for example, tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the musik.tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files by simply dropping can be difficult. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all pieces attached to you for playing. you can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location. once you enter letters there will be only the pieces that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter delimited search terms by spaces, & Amarok will search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter a two three, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the OR keywords, search for entries containing either one or the other search term. for example, one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two OR three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then enclose the search term with goose-feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield does, but not for entries like Mike Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">For example: rating: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this is looking for all pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the order sequence of entries by holding the Ctrl key, and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some of the functions of the playlist. on the left hand side you will find the Add feature that lets you add pieces to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1478">The table view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, as long as a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The headbar is a narrow area, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headbar has no real function, it only looks nice and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window for changing the keystrokes for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the keyboard allocation accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this you need system administrator rights, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here, general program settings can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work straight away. this dialog is intended for personalizing and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP; -Interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so it is more of your taste and type of task, which the contributing programs give you the preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you are using the dcop command line. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; -functions that all have common, supported & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatting DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void copymural () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void ScreenDvd () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burndImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method one gets a DCOP reference to the newly generated project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using this reference is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be used on data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString Name, QString) void addUrl (QString Name, QString) void addUrl (QString Name, QString) void addUrl (Qstring path) void renameItem (QString Name, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (QString)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">I / bin / bash PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / home / trueg / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audio creator; is an audio CD; -reader for & kde;. with it can easily be audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are also possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audio creator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many encoder that encoding these WAV files (compressing). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default. additional encoders can be added to the program (if installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats like lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coders must be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary to compile anything themselves. however, only the encoders need to be installed, which are needed. if for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to coding, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & audio creator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device avoids the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanism of copy protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling of reading a & CD will be explained on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface, which you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step, for example, there are more information on how to use this program, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">If the CDDB request of the CD data starts in accordance with the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be made.)</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the default. it is important to note that previously the encoder was configured in the Settings dialog tab.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already-read file is selected to encode instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages (such as logs, pics) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main direction dialog from & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as encoder, to set up the encoders). here, you must go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you to choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho-acoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG might have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but this bit rate makes the difference less important, since both codes produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'Not so' free, lame is nevertheless supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but slightly lower quality compared to OGG at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playdevices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - when music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see the 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression ratio up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression ratio about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression ratio about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information entered manually or automatically fetched by the program from the freedb over the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / needed with & kaudio creator; and the coding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding guides explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; to add titles to keywords when encoding MP3s with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audio creator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the computer. it is important to note that only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (with the translator: this meant the author) bin not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from being harmed by the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music business can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kashcreator; is actively to choose a check box (Send a address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (counterfeit) address as the one in the system. in this kind of configuration, it appears, the email address when retrieving the data from the server is not used (this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudio creator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval from & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia will be used; if you want to know more, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not been done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other codes can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The coding package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined codes. more information about encoders can be found in the section Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, you can obtain more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; read out. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine as it is considered to be not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write permissions on it (eg; by trying to copy something into it with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & audio creator; something that is likely to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each release & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it with each reading of a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found once.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -Data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card General Settings. there is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only with incomplete information you will be able to select, so that you will be informed if data is missing for creating keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -settings. simply select both items. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically downloaded via the internet from a freedb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; record found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; renamed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, this is more than 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first one.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the freedb section.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the computers. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number simultaneously displayed: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading out the last piece: check this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you tick this, you can specify the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not enabled, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be flipped to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good hifi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a dual-core or quadcore or even a multi processor machine can be tried to encode more than one wav file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just have the basic set-up of & audio creator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; use. if you chose the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD takes place on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was set up in the previous section and set up.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data collected for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; enter data manually instead of retrieving them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example can be found. it's a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, consult the FAQ section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD has been successfully retrieved from the freedb, all the songs are already filled in and the artist's name and album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there will be a window in, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you did not select the check box for the automatic query from freedb (on the page & CD; -settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current title' unless you have a composition with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field can be used for individual comments. the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you are using ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & audio creator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the outgoing CD; in this example, this is not important since we do not provide the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the BOM.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line turns the selection of the piece into or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All Pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click on the selection process to start reading the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab order to switch to the order window. it is in the left top half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read out on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will be displayed if you are trying to work with a codec you haven't already installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we've entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the MP3 format. this allows reading and encoding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding. with powerful machines, the result is unclear. the used computer with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem at the simultaneous reading and encoding (however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the coding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; -support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with varying color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop to drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events) .kmid automatically determines the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you finish & kde; when playing a song, kmid starts again with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window into the & kmid; -Window will drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the play button in the toolbar, select the entry Abplay from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; -Window. (in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and driving with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows left and right of the Tempograph and adjust the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar, such as a pressure on the break button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, interrupts playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics event and again other both. some pieces don't have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song uses, so you don't have to manually set the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the text events and / or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these will be played in the row. in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu item under the item Organise.... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired amount in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not saved. remember that if you add lots of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. there, again, the file dialog, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatically add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then add the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the pop-up sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next Song button, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back to a song, select the button forecast piece, the entry Preve item from the menu item or press the key arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not saved when you leave & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer comprehends.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that transforms all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always allows a trumpet to sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need any MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as you wish. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Keymap"... END Define Keymap "Another key map"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can provide in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you will see how General MIDI Patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60) that sounds similar to a rifle.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, with which each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as is their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are mainly used to depict sounds on the percussion channel. take a look at the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channels, just do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap with the name Name for this channel is used. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">If a pitch Bender event sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this will be converted to the n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM presumes that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid; around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played right now.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to show the played sounds. in the View menu, select Settings from the channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, so supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; -Window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or tacked (if I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, just change to the & konqueror; -window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly, without adding it to a collection, turn off automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, I encourage myself to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have much time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or if you want to make me simply happy, write to me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really enjoy it if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all of which send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anyone for it. I would like to point out that I only need to keep programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Thank you also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error message or even a supporting email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid can also be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view images. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you must compile and kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it will run as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of formats supported by MPlayer or phonon formats, as well as playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for and kappname; has not yet been finished as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the Bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Persistent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and the play starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' up-to-date pieces', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / directory can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select playlists from the same menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions may only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable another animation. & SME; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / SME / Exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying in the end-animation, so the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture: & lt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; img dur = "content: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet"; & lt; / Corporates; In the Inventory of & KMPlayer; are included in the tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & KMPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the console toolbar in the SMB toolbar. here is an indication of mplayer output.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, like setting up the backend by mimetype. here's an example of how a flash is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & SMB; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the set-up dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there are no errors here, the backend output is within & KMplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend is always taken for a certain Mime type (of course only if this has been determined), it must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SME Player; can play from TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be looked up, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do so, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quel- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be used. there, ports should be detected by which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since VDR support can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, SKMPlayer uses various names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, dvdnavsource, dvdsource, source, introversion, pipesource, tvanners, TVSource, url source, vcdsource and vdb source. if enabled, start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any clues how to make my CDROM drive more quiet if I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be done as root after inserting the device, making sure that / dev / cdrom indicates the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts up slowly, why should my CPU be checked for performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhauled. kxineplayer automatically needs the last stored value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, convert and print DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back-search, the elements of the DVI; file are connected to the editor and once on an element in the DVI; file is clicked, the exact opposite of it. as soon as you clicked on a section in the & latex; -Source code, you jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; -viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set about project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Express: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are any errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file will be overwaamed for the renders and there is no call of & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing toolbar, you should see the three large selection fields. the selection fields have been developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for the quick integration of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The drop-down selector For further items such as tags, notes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for one section, a picture or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: used for reference to a defined term (selectable via a drop-down selector).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a drop-down list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; files corresponding editors are necessary. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down selector named Gray e is used for defining the font size. you can specify the font size for the main text, the notes notes etc. there are the following fonts available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile; there are two choices available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12 pt] defines the font size. if the font size is not specified at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the source code above has to be entered, the & latex source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Building or button quick assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, it should be searched in the logging after the errors. if you use rapid build-ups & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size e 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font size. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} allows the change of the font size within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be overhauled within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no limit (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many ways to obtain the readability and usability of the document. for example, it can be added to certain fonts, grease pressure, italic pressure, submissions, etc. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for the italic pressure and is valid until it is closed with an\\ end {emph} or another environment.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code was presented with the & latex; markup language, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile is now followed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a little text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments may be made for the better readability of the document. for this, a quote, a few passages in bold and italic pressure and a poem are to be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be returned to the editor using editor-view or Ctrl E (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (English D e V ice I née). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, you can print the document by file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI, file from the & latex; -Source code was created, the conversion into desired other formats can start using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The search result allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a suitable setting for all & latex; -binaries. for this purpose, only Modern can be set up under Settings box... tools are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the preliminary search, the mouse cursor has to be positioned in a row of the source text and then clicked to the search request. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; -viewer is then performed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -Document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & Kile; open and skip to the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is a mistake in using the quick construction of the & DVI, there may be an error. if there is an error, it will be summarized in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file erases the source code in the source code. in the editor, then the buttons of Preferences LaTeX errors and patches of LaTeX errors can be used for errors between the errors. the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you click on the button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template you want to use for the document. the preset options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">¤ufige users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be open or a new file needs to be created.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file New, some strings may be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings boxes... settings General set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are being replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering the document class. typically it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the template can then be selected instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. an easy way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Posters; as internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Posters; can be done in the menu Tools directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & makes; and to experience its possibilities, the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start working there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very handy & latex; command reference which can be invoked above the menu LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; and their syntax.</seg>

<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a left left mouse button, the selected text will automatically be copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search and highlight different types of source texts. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizards can add additional snap-marks. this is an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu entries do make a jump to the nearest or last jump-mark. this is also highlighted by this jumping-mark, so that it is automatically deleted at the first entry of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the key aspects when using a program such as & Kile;. although & Posters; already offers excellent possibilities, have been added to & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; -Source textes added. & latex; special commands for their selection. under Edit Selection, the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Specify a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning is not meant to include tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also wilt & latex; -commands with a back-line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Posters; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is contained in the description to Edit Selection paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore offers & kile; for further commands under editing surroundings for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the start of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is above or within the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command will close the most recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; -groups defined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curly clip.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curled bracket of a & tex; -group #, will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many nested welded groups-brackets you can quickly lose the overview over. this command completes the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; the character is used in & Kile; the character is used for two simple instructions. also for the end of the guide the sign "is used. & Kile; knows this case and has two binding quotes for latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic add-on for the double attraction sign can be set up in the Settings box... LaTeX will be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for country-specific settings (e.g., german or French) and thus German or French add-on characters. many other languages are available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When using Shift; Enter Enter & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, the current line with\\\\ is terminated with an ending line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et characters (amp;) to each other. & Kile; try to do this. while using Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the nearest tab in the above line. although this tab is not necessary, add & Kile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already offers good source-code completion, it has been added to & Kile; three modes are built-in. three of them work on demand and the other two are designed for automatic processing. all these modes can be set up for different working methods in the Settings box... Completely set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">Start a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last character of the input will be removed and, as a result, the list is enlarged. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are then removed from the selection of a command. alternatively you can add bounce marks, so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing hocks nests, and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">In the Settings box; set up... Kile; Completely adjustments can be made to these lists. you can select different martyrs for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as wipes for the common language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for completing environments. there are always a few characters to be entered with\\ begin and calling the execution mode will result in a large list of ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are often used to provide a special mode for completing environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the Completeness Mode on the MenÃ ¼ Edit Lossable Environment or the Ckey Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears\\ begin. after that, the ambient execution can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button it can be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & box recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Settings box; set up... Kile; Enable settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ rter List of the Notification Mode for tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support custom lists of abbreviations, which can be replaced immediately by longer strings. the lists can be set up in the Settings box... boxes can be set up example.cwl, in which, for example, the file L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is initiated by the menu Edit Verfullfilled abbreviation or the Ctrl + Alt key button, the character L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Great WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic processing. however, it has been found that many wipers are written more than once in a document.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu Settings box... Let boxes be switched off. here, the treshold can also be specified for displaying completion.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The processing files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / the PersÃ ¶ nliche home folder. mode stands for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog shapes the insertion of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics to the graphics formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; -tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to examine the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are compiled in the MenÃ ¼ s Creating compiling, Creating conversion and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewers such as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by pressing alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be seen in the standard viewer using Alt; 3, using Alt; 4 the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>

<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML files will be deleted every time my proc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As already said, everyone who worked on the & kde; -documentation has already worked, knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical interface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the currently opened file index.docbook is, just select the current working folder. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">If it comes to output on the screen, your file is defective. please check the reported error and try again.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, that are called & quantaplus, have with & quantaplus, even possibly little to do. thus, the plug-in system becomes very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in & quantaplus. the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we will begin editing the Edit Plugins section. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all included plugins and add new ones. we describe each and GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location use & quantaplus, this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project project properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unambiguous identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold when you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for more information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event can be created for information to team leaders when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific occurs within the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone was working on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Settings dialog can create, edit and delete events.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addsat can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To enter comments is simple. either the remark entry can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment section followed by annotation text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">In this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with nickname of the set nickname of the team member, is part of the project from the following possibilities: team leader, Subproject Manager After the area and subproject leaders, the respective area or sub-project names should be given, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages, the DTD agnostic and web-based formatting and scripting languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the Settings menu. here, only via & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Settings can be set up using settings Quanta... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be modified therewith. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Big / Low-write of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal big / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower case of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal capitalization means the attributes are inserted in such a way as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags automatically include: if checked, tags for which the closing tag is optional will be inserted immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not automatically include optional tags: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish date automatically update: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding code during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mime types for detecting different types of files. by using the Standard button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard sign encoding: the encoding of newly created files or in other ways than with file opened files (where the encoding of the file can be passed). but this setting here is ejected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the chosen DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been recognized. however, this setting here is ejected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one's own view (or the documentation in a cardboard box), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface has passed through changing the MDI modes and docking / appending views. it is equivalent to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages range is used to control the display of alerts by hook-up of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of / VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behaviour of the VPL- and the source text view in shared mode. regarding the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of the parser knots in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of node in the tree, which is to be opened automatically when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be automatically opened. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are the ones where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are grouped in groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s may be valid, divided. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the clause abbreviation is something different than in a group for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The plug-ins can be managed here. plugins are KPart applications from the third page, which can be reused by each KPart-enabled application, the most known and konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Loading component in the "Only-read" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load the load. only-read-kPlusParts usually refuse charging if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then test and quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, then save the entry if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely newly developed. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger-plug-in concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed, with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to DebugGen session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or stops listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server for a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the View debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debug request has started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution will proceed. if it happens before a request has been made, the execution will begin as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger runs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger runs the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include in it is corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instruct the debugger to skip the instruction and go to the next one as if there were no current.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg, which they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can and quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you & quantaplus can help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus, to provide support for markup and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they allow & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility make & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages respectively & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and toolbars. tag folder contains two file types, the tag folder and toolbars. tag folders are handy, symbolic links of image knobs (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, 1 & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML Files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, den & quantaplus; for the day shows. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insert of tags into a document without a risk of a write failure.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder bear the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but one element type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when used it is used & lt; attr &gt; an argument of function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid for class class only. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute set and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. in addition, there are other tags describing how this attribute should be shown & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source texts used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & Quantaplus; will be used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the source of data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A tag that groups the elements of a list together. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; Declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt; replaced. this will not cause a leg termination, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is up in the & quantaplus; -Window to start and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check takes place only when loading TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file there is a & PHP; overloading function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returntype = "void" &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD Editor DTD settings. this can be edited diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = default 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be created with settings actions... created. clicking New action will lead to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The shortcut abbreviation assigned to this action. by clicking the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that will change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the various See in... actions for (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line: global script folder: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process replaces. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is flagged to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & Quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script input from & quantaplus can be received; in the input box input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default input.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written on the standard output; error messages, based on the standard error output. it can be specified, what should be done with the text written on the default output, by setting the value of the selection field:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in any given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it, activate dialog "Edit Tag" if available so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igam! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, graphic other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size other.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In view that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will usually be interpreted as los, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol will be inserted; startles; -Tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the action you want.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue using other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar, or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into multiple groups. open the toolbar dialog using settings toolbars. make sure the required toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by validating all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup to the right folder. after New XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please customize your & descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most noteworthy extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. this is why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top element = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html tag 1 = day 1.html tag 2 = day 2.html tag 3 = day 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; Documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # off Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit to the depth of the box (except the reason) mdash; but try it out for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but make sure to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateien.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the range of the docrc file, which is used to design context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script to display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (contextual list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of text-separated contextual elements to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc just after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (like you specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you won't get rich, but proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the disk resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different places, there is an e-mail menu entry like DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where everyone else & quantaplus. contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make a significant contribution we recommend to sign the resources, for which it requires a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have several keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can stay empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, tested & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signification. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by & quantaplus. however, the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag XML format. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can start from menu DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which is to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definition line: the string that will appear in! Doctype Tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd to appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of DTEP after conversion: when enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand them and gain full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is considered global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this enables the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to anyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory, so that they can only be used in person.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be all from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are emailed in the project's folder tree, which emoglows common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the constructional views, the flashcards with information and the toolbars. please beat in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the right mouse button in order to obtain a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all card leaders, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, skip to bookmarks or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Rectangle in the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cutting / pasting / pasting), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click on the icon that represents the tag. now, you can enter the data for this recently added tag. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumaninsights (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and roam. in the representation with card-guides are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation building views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that gives & quantaplus; this view shows all the files in the project and allows administrators to manage the files in the project using the right mouse click. actions such as add, remove, upload or delete the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; It is open to all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project. more templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by the right-click of an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree opens.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree-views. with it, it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the entry system geared to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two guides at the bottom of the window where the information can be accessed: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; -Scripts executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the toolbar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive over & kmail; if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus; like any other!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the & quantaplus; for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting with & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kDE; 3 in the PATH in front of your bin folder. the same is for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for a quick web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus would be? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer restricted to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community is based. thanks to the & kde; framework is not only this all possible, but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost impossible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; plus is in no way affiliated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is available with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; or helpfull help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest record being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there, converts special characters to the & html; -Sign so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard into & URL; -Description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s first line to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Turning and turning the problem reporter at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to place bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents are grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -Projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Creates a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows for example to copy video files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded other input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, like & quantaplus, manage the project. you will find details in chapter & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions need to be added using settings actions... or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars by clicking on the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars to the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Upload an & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities of the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be refreshed without updating the entire & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE directory, the loading fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current Tag Settings dialog if there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insert of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insert means that & quantaplus is denied the insertion by tool bar when this day contradicts the rules in this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. clicking on an activated plug-in activates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the posters; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; with the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant change between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or cause insignificant graphics. the card card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindows mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will influence any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbars, or which you can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the mouse pointer environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled out from top to bottom, since, for example, after filling out the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering Name, file is filled out automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. in case of serversive scripts (e.g., PHP, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is restarted from scratch, no hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option displays all files and folders within the folder and you can make an accurate selection according to the code.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded to the menu tree in the menu tree in the sub-window profiles or Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail. additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible), which are re-read in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This way the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, high-load profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by attaching its own tree view to each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindows Team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a predefined event occurs, such as the backing of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior can not be influenced at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the menu Projects or the Symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus is closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files finds. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and opening with... in the context menu on the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only more one profile exists, the button is dazzled to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten at the end of the program. this option is useful when frequent upload of files is needed and the rather unsafe password stored on the disk option is not available.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high load profiles can be created and therefore the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it can not be read easily, but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in a project, i.e. by simply rotating the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the project toolbar menu or project toolbar, accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with whom one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus; best stacked through the toolbar menu. use and addition differ. adding toolbars is discussed below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions can be executed like toolbars, renaming toolbars or setting tool bars, which can be specified, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, additional entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with Settings... and set settings for actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus. you can copy, move, or link any directory existing to the system in the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus, supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, special documents are placed in appropriate subfolders. a simple framework for the purpose and organises work in a corresponding way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">These templates are useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl-based.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & html;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As Template Save As Local Template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (although stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Binary templates are simple: just copy the file into a template folder. all file management functions can be used to drag and drop, or paste over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files, and select a site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is secured in the project folder, but of course it can be stored in the same way as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can pre-insert headlines and footers, or dynamically combine with & PHP; create, insert or link files with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / tmp and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder, and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selector dialog with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled when parental attribute is inherently contested.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set so, it would be explicitly enabled in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text building block. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or provided text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying content templates into a folder with special headers / footers a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders, copying and pasting templates from one location to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it downloads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back if needed to the source code editor, where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit, the source text editor is still required. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor is active and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; this mode is already active, the key has the active cursor from one window to the other, while the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and source text editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in the selection automatically, the time span can be set.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & knu3;? let me explain briefly why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & knu3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned and knu3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two persons independently work on one piece of code and make changes. the merge editor among the differences windows allows to resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& knu3; helps you to merge and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & knu3; in the merge-merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& knu3; displays the exact differences and complies with the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to check frequently, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Cordi3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open Dialogue allows you to manually type filenames, select the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the Open Dialogue opens up your selection and displays them again next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences is done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By clicking the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing or merging of folders will be initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C a folder, then use & knu3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not essential to immediately specify an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting to merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & knu3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the open dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you'd first need to create two corresponding files, load them in & knu3, and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't remove anything & knu3; only drop text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dragging of text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one can see at the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merging) well to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and commentaries, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line of broken lines is dotted dotted.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the title output:, the filename and [changes] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the button Springe to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also highlight a jump to the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merging or manual editing; then in these lines the text & lt; no row in the queue. this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in any mark you may copy and paste.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. proceed cautiously with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate primarily with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, side ab, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-End, Siw as you are also used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the default window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-picture Aboutwards) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you must copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-paste). if this is enabled, whatever you mark, is automatically copied to the clipboard and no manual copying. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Newlines are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the newlines of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the run and restored at the next start (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides font with variable width to select, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the chosen font does not support this representation nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered rendered. on these systems the button presets automatically insert an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab sign will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files & knu3; first, find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even when merging, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, while others save only a newline character, although they are different. if this option is enabled, the carriage return character will be made visible, but like a white sign. during the merge operation, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">This option is disabled in default. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Look intensely for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically resolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (preset is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflict in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in the chapter for scanning of folders and performing a merge. look for details under documentation of the directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you must & knu3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is in the KDE version of & knu3; not available because the language is set global over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">A short notice of what the local coding is about the selection fields for encoding appears. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding to store for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress changes in white characters in the text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This option is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; & gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will be displayed next to the normal column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just leave the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. merging the current file in the merge-menu also works if you only compare two files. a simple click launches the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge operation, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & knu3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your requirements. you can use this function e.g. for cutting troublesome parts or correcting the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessing command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line derivatives. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' [and ']' is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so it is almost deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER' However, perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for the display and to merge. the other operations only change the data that the line algorithm algorythm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers in a folder need to edit many files. for this reason you can compare and merge complete folders in recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... perform selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as a base. if no destination folder was specified, use & knu3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, do not merge. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message panel about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folders, only the files that were then compared are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the file is completed, shows & knu3; a list window with the results on the left hand side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All sub-directories and open all sub-directories with which you can open or fold all directories.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the Details Pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be notified of any problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries varies.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then, folders also have the same color. at folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is green, then yellow and later, when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (for example, if A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (for example, if A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified, and if the option synchronizes directories. then select & knu3; the necessary action to ensure that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merging and storing the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; directly after merging copies & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option New File instead of merge is enabled, then check & knu3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the merge of the folders can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">When merging, one file is processed after the other. it shows your status column heels when merging successfully, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When the file comparison method is selected in the alignment dialog, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all clash actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have a target folder, then the three-folder merging mode C is used as the target, while two-folder merging B is selected as the target and when syncing, A and / or B is used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to merge only the current entry, select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that indicates the erroneous elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options Through, Simulation and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& knu3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge-window opens (notice the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are done with a file, you can restart / resume directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & knu3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you click on an error, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to issue the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually merged, you can see & knu3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them together again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered as completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & knu3; (Settings menu - &gt; KDiff3 Set...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are shown in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically created files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder specific can be set with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hide attribute. in other file systems, a preceding points. a file is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element-tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is turned on, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: when the option is turned on, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively examined. (note that & knu3; not for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a loop and & kdiff3;) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders using a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of safety.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The files are considered identical if they are equal to size. this can be useful, for example, if the change date has been lost when copying. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables Synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging files will be selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the copy of the newer file is proposed as an action. (this is considered insecure, because the knowledge is presumed that the other file has not been altered too.) This option is disconnected in any case.)</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .original extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of single files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the merge view view stays visible while merging single files; you can move the window-divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views using the switch between the directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file with a double click. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also directly merge a single file, without first having to merge the folder. to do so, use the function Actual file merging from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, empty string &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # has the URL: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. there is a short list of restrictions:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or folder. then a file as a link target is always assumed. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way of editing authorizations or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (please note the option familiar to the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference-viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select in KDiff3Part display from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually needed & knu3; two complete input files. if it is however used as a part, it takes up & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & knu3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select a Preview in - KDiff3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & knu3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is a compact) already exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that merging can be combined like the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by stowed in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or going to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably not told the configure script to KDE. in default, configure installs in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only one non-white character is different, the line is considered not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this is the case but this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After the text is removed, no src is left; no src is left and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& knu3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & knu3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found in http: / / knu3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the Log File in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the basic folder of the & knu3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & knu3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have problems while compiling. however, if difficulties arise, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift Remove) Copy to the clipboard and clears the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-paste) insert the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders don't appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you must re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files are not copied to the target folder when merging. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior is probably changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the A, B and C button below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already existing). if the lines are already present, you will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">This option is disabled in default. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual work surfaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both within a desktop as well as multiple.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can view all virtual work surfaces as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; motion is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background by & Kpager, the context menu only contains the two entries Pager... and endings. if however, on an application within & Kpager; click, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minimizing, maximizing, On Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in the & Kpager; the names of the virtual work surfaces are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of the virtual desktops. if it is enabled together with the name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only empty work surfaces are displayed to allow them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Simply display simple rectangles with the proportions of the program windows. icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main window can be determined: classic leaves & pager; in a 2xN grid, as from pager applications in some other windows managers; horizontally, all virtual work surfaces are displayed in horizontal and vertical position in a vertical row, which is very good for the representation on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display the windows as symbols or with their contents and move them. besides, it runs out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then select switch settings... lets the dialog display settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / kpagerrc with any text editor, such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't have write permission for the file, you must log in as a user root or contact your system administrator. in this file you have to enter the key windowTransparent mode and assign it to this one. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2480">This application is interesting for different users: these include artists, web designers, and people with visual impairment. this documentation is intended to be a complete guide to the use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new features. it is optimized for use on high-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; displays the magnified area of the screen. in the following, this window is labeled as a magnifying window. in the following, this window is called magnifying window and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer is like a mobile magnifier. alternatively you can & Kmag; cause a selected screen area in the magnification window (dropdown mode) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note that the mouse pointer is currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold down the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the content of the magnification window. this is also possible with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press & Shift; press or use the & MMB; you can move the drop-down window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window stays firm and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& KQ; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it into a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the ad update. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to switch to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& KQ; automatically uses your inserted short commands to store files, open a new window, print, reloads (re-load the document in the & konqueror;), zoom, zoom, etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag also known as & kmagnifier; it is a screen magnifier. you can use & kmagnifier; to use a magnifier area, as if you would use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer persists for a while on the same spot. it is intended to help people suffering from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome, and every mouse click can emulate pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer should be caused by pain. if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not been done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; to avoid pain caused by mouse clicks, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic auxiliary agents, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent pushing activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it has emulated the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the drag while pressed mouse button. the intelligent pushing requires a little practice, but you get accustomed to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; mouse-click carries out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligently Move is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 sec) is activated. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after dropping the mouse button, wait until the mouse button is released again, if no moving of the mouse is done in the meantime.</seg>

<seg id="2506">When the sound appears, you can & kde; move to shorten reaction time. go to the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the Rider General. there's a slider sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; please consult the respective documentation at GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with presets. in particular, the intelligent slide should be switched off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart postpone.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to reduce sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not result in unwanted reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is bucking, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse. as this happens, mouse is different to the mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located at the sides of the hole into which the ball was inserted. you can scrape the dirt and the soiling easily with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts execution of the & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent push-button in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click. this will reset the status of the & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another position.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to make a keystroke. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around toolbars and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent pushing, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent pushing is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to highlight text, copy it into the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move when you just start using & kmousetool; use the text instead: at the end of the text area, press a mouse click and hold the shift key while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when to move the move time when you move smart. later, you can use the intelligent slide even without the audible mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; this should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and is set up correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2621">Text is processed in filters before it is sent to the speech speech schedule. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace unspoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and orator or to deal with certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the way they work, it is important to know how the speech "speech-dispatcher" works with a text.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of screen readers is read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and stops the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; you can read a long text on a web page, you can welcome with & kmouth; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest is simple text orders. any order you send orders from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues except the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one of these reads, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there may be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String substitute replaces parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; formers use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters, you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts. if you have set a female voice on the speaker chart for example, you can read the text of KDE news about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it continues to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. the processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the normal filters set up. if a filter is not enabled, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filter, and the further below set-up dialogs will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For set-up filters, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily; it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Erput. the list is processed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program qdbus; the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copete-3432 shows, you may only enter it.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Diesen filter apply if the same. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. words must be limited on both sides by separators (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have the & kde; editor & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the package kdeutils.</seg>

<seg id="2651">With the speaker selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the card speaker or to a speaker with certain features. for example, you can specify that texts should be read by kmail from a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text is handed over to the filter, it is looking for a speaker for the text. the speaker is chosen based on the speaker properties that the program specifies, which sends the text to & ktops; with the speaker selection filter, you can override the chosen speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone for Sable to work at all. you'll need to do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages. make sure that the program xsltproc is installed and found over the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation marks seem to cause mistakes in the synthesizer, so that whole sentences are skipped or just chewing catfish is spent. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">Make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, they may be fixed by a string replacement filter.</seg>

<seg id="2677">Speech-Dispatcher's program uses an adaptable module architecture for speech synthesizers. if you want to extend it for the use of another synthesizer, please contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSml and for the & XML; conversion filter is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including packages and development files for the program "speech-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you include the source code of the tarball from the source code archive or downloaded the tarball currently created every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you start typing, check first whether speech-dispatcher works correctly with your speech synthesizer. for this you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The program kttmsgr is to be developed in such a way that speech-dispatcher's set-up is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sentences. the user can return propositional or paragraph mode, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have a speaker set up, whose language is English and its gender is female, it is used, otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; a speaker selects, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add a Speaker on Add, and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit, the card box for speaker setup will be displayed. as an example, the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules please refer to.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival in PATH is included, you only have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival. in case of voices, the & ktts; known, this setting will be done automatically. generally, Western languages are ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some regulators and show this gray, the voice you selected does not allow these settings to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTL so that (with greater memory consumption) the first set is synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click Apply). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window kttsmgr will be displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after startup only the kttsmgr will be visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the symbol in the system section to show the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr does not work yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTL reads a text.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all orders listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently edited set. the spokesperson ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series you can pre- or return sparingly in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With one click on OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other card cards) will be taken over and kttsmgr will be scaled down to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to show the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If you want to use GStreamer or aCode for the audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are shown in the list, you must install at least one module. if you select ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">The program sox must be installed so that these settings can be implemented, so that these settings can be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to apply the new settings for the current & tt; -system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of these will not work. you must find out which device works with you. in case of doubt choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed if the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message.</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. after the output of Screen Reader has been read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next higher priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning stops the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that pronounces messages. if you & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can welcome with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who is entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, adds and ktts; the audio output in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both sound and introductory messages are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings and screen readers' messages if they are interrupted by a higher priority message.</seg>

<seg id="2717">If you have selected user-defined text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter the characteristics of the speaker you want here. default selects the speaker that is displayed in the list on the card speaker as the top entry.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, it is executed. otherwise, the action is executed for all other events of the particular application. as the last option is the action to carry, which was specified under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All Notifications for the Application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this, you can set the pre-read notifications as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the notification settings to a file. use the Save button to load saved settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all items except All Notifications are deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to select text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviations. SSml is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktops; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male), since this is the default voice, the festival is used in the output of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the speed or pitch settings are not set to 100% in the festival configuration dialog, SSml text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" http: / / www.w3.org / TR / speech synthesis / Synthesis 1.0 / / EN "http: / / www.w3.org / TR / speech synthesis / Synthesis...] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional limits filter (SDB filter). SBDs can start typing text into individual sentences. this can be done faster with reading, since only the first set needs to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional view filters. at the first start of the sequence, a set-up filter will be set up automatically. you can change its settings or add further propositional limits filter, but beginners will get discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set the speaker selection by trying out. switch off the speaker selection and enter text to read. switch back the speaker selection, change some features and check how the choice of speaker is changed. of course, you need to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with the reading can start, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is set up automatically when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it can not be switched off, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Syntax limit filters compare text with a regular expression for bylaws and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) to the propositional borders (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the default set limit filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -News (known to notify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal propositional view filter from accidentally, you can insert this again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can override the speaker settings for the application on the board selection chart.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the card board speaker). in other words: no speaker properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker with all the characteristics of a speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, choose & tts; this speaker. otherwise, select the speaker, which is most likely to match the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the speaker you want here. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to take precedence over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may want to specify the language is before, if you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the pop-up button and then use the speaker that is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr stops immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get backtracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is the command of the recently registered GStreamer-0.8. if the problem is not solved, GStreamer is probably a non-compatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to upgrade or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA doesn't work if I play music at the same time with another application. if I stop a text order, freezes & ktts; one. on the & console; appears a message saying: Unto open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">The problem is that conflicts with ALSA appear on your system, preventing simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have downloaded an extra voice for the festival from the Internet. I have installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / neuropint / Voices, add the new voice. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order to work, the program must be installed sox and can be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizersmoduls such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the board card for speakers. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSml;) Deactivate either the filter for converting from & html; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & html; -after-SSml reforming filter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it happen that websites are read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker but & tts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the Tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. thus, the festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file to convert from SSml to Saber is the GENDER tag. the same applies to the VOICE-tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string release filter and now I can go back or go back in & ktons; no more ways to set it forward or go back. on the map runner orders is displayed, the order consists only of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You must not filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead, use a filter for the propositional pattern recognition instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer, by using GStreamer in & ktops; execute the command-register. (HTTP: / / gstrema.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system also counts, you can't play music at the same time and read a text. it also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you stop a text order in & ktons, the current sentence will still be read.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the microphone speed, but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install sox using the apt-get install sox command. the program is already included on most and Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you have downloaded and ktops; as a tarball (tar-packed archive), login as normal user and unzip the tarball into a matching folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kDE; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for speech synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a running time dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2765">As default is installed and ktts; in / opt / kde3. if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify the --prefix = destination option. for example</seg>

<seg id="2767">CD kdeaccessibility echo td &gt; inst-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before you start typing, check first if your speech synthesizer works correctly. follow the instructions you received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and multiple voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You will need to install at least one language. you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes stage 1.95 beta or new. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / Voices / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone for the voices. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) coding, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions, so check the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech language, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA, synthesizer. then, Festival takes over lexical analysis and & MBROLA, which generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -Programme and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no complete language output system. & MBROLA; generates language from diphone files. you need additional software to create this diphone. festival generates this from & MBROLA; required diphone. txt2pho can also produce from German text diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this process additional wrapper code is added to festival to use & MBROLA; -Voices for voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA files are not installed in the & MBROLA, but in the folder Festival / lib /. instructions can be found under</seg>
<seg id="2779">IMS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German & MBROLA. required is either festival version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first install Festival and & MBROLA, then download MS German Festival from</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetwork.conf, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows the management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetwork.-package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetwork.conf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings at the & kcontrolcenter will be displayed. the module network settings (knetwork.conf;) can be started by selecting the kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in the & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.conf; network hardware can not install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable & knetwork.conf to show the device at all and allow setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>

<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain data by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The computer for the name resolution part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed .DNS records can be ranked by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with the buttons Hindered or Herunder in priority.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient to install and kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & Co is sufficient; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, in the second section all of the commands are discussed by & knetwork.conf.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section does not replace any further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about integrating the PC into a small (home) network is communicated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IPv5 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to persevere in the near future. therefore, IPv6 is currently concentrating on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in foreign networks, at the & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point, which is available to a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, mostly addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section, you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf, where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which also provided dds2tar's ability for fast, selective unpacking. the second aim was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be included by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; discus the tape back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detects & kdat; the default on the tape does not, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the default, searches for the right index on your disk. if this is not found, you'll be asked if the strip index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything goes smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been incorporated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by unfolding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been loosened and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar. the tape can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not require formatting at & kdat; if your tape drive needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before you are formatted by the tape of & kdat; floppy disk drives usually require formatting of tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and capacitance, continue with the format of the tape. all data on the tape will be lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a security profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so-marked files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select the...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test has started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can redirect the restore, the files that should be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Recovery from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has started, the dialog appears for restoration. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the restoration settings, the dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the tape index file on the basis of the tape content. this process clears all existing index files for this tape. you can re-create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed in backup files, only the files contained in the same file system are backed up, such as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Performing an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then have been saved.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding option of the tape unit.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is mounted the command blocks load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; lock the throw at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the tape is released when it is released; automatically discarded the tape. do not use this option for floppy-Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to & kdat; in any case, share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band id. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds preceding the era in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU, tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports different protocol files. in addition, it enables quick access, for example, on information about problems occurring on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, it enables experienced users to provide quick access to information about problems occurring on their server. therefore, it attempts to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a set of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the syslog server format and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available to easily filter and sort each protocol line of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog, first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will open. will not show you this, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very probably not started with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log, for regular users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criteria or after entered strings. the list of the protocol lines will now be changed automatically, so that only the log lines will be displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system log, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so you show & ksystemlog; all protocol lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as protocol lines of the level hint.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process. this may be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter strip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can use the option to jump to new lines in the main window's context menu, in order to display all new add-on protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. as soon as you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more current information about the Sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">In addition, find the following folder: - Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when starting the system in the & Linux world. it is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting. the & Linux; kernel first looks under / etc after an init file.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of / etc. this folder is called rc.d, and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service you want to start when you boot the system or when you switch to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a serial port in / etc / rc.d.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for the program init at different places and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the initial area, you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you can repair it by rebooting the system and running the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would pause the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel running only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runlevel to launch it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between levels, or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. this will not happen unless you pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. in order to only copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the contextual menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The serial number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the Sorrow numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it by cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sort number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with standard-leveling and now the machine is restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using any other distribution, please check that all configuration files are provided by the respective system service (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without message if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to and kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation from & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made any changes, you must save them. either use the toolbar icon or save the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double-click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created, where you can make individual settings. additional flashcards will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD / Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card file appears in the case of shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd, as in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if there is limited space limitation for at least one integrated filesystem space limitation (quota) and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quotigroup on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space restrictions are in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the filesystem with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups inform groups about the group members of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or selected group functions analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO bootloader, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
