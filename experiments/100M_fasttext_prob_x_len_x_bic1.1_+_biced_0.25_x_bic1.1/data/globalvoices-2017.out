although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magnet that wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if it is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , its diversity so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks of the mountain with his opinion , as one says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in favor of him .
the 13 million votes he won in Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t bring Tru@@ mp and his voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply religious person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also , Tru@@ mp Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung agreed not with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
mps In@@ tolerance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for her lifetime , and to her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp was making his way to nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a footh@@ old and the counterpart of his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception to the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white men , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of them know , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( h@@ m . Ü ) : as much as &quot; white vs. all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; white @-@ white pu@@ n @-@ play against wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones called , has exactly killed what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices got lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not be like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son was pleased sent him a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now Tru@@ mp Land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that is breaking my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love of music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
picture of Fli@@ ck@@ r user OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ ean town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with rub@@ b@@ ish
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian &apos;s English newspaper wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group seriously , writes the local press not@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laughing and playing with shining eyes and playing in the bu@@ stle you learn to play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located virtually at the top of the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments , made of local solid waste materials , is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all of which were made out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in The Los Angeles Times , Fla@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash The children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
that changed when Fa@@ vio was something he had never seen before : a violin @-@ made violin .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights illegal illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ release occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa at that time it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the waters of Liberia , before it searched the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were upset by this and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries Authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was unable to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia for pil@@ la@@ ging fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network , alongside Somalia and Madagascar , are the six countries that then expelled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; this way we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and interact with each other where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by ignor@@ ing existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while action against illegal fishing was once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail emp@@ o , with which information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with track@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also carefully tracks the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to flag ships which fish in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they may even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer financially worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenues , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these illegal fishermen .
their practices include sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , imag@@ inary names , fishing @-@ protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an incomplete control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 suspi@@ ci@@ ons of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i locate suspi@@ cious ships more accurately .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal boats they like to hide .
&quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their positions , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so that they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i will help to find discrimin@@ atory ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing World@@ watch together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Organization : a platform that offers satellite data and is able to display the position of each tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also sc@@ are them off .
ships which previously f@@ ished without a license and had hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have a 33 % increase in fishing net sales since fishing boats have bought more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were on board tow@@ ing nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries joined the West Africa Task Force in 2015 . now they are fighting illegal fishing , exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; With security , the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used tra@@ w@@ l nets which are now forbidden .
the ship was also entered into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world .

her articles are published in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s office .

after the government had rejected Venezuela &apos;s request for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country were running , re@@ acted by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the reg@@ ression of Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also being held in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the minist@@ erial exercise of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; in the end , however , the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises the context of the government decision as follows in her latest article :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and profit rate are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine is concerned , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( roughly : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , called on the demonstr@@ ators to participate in the elections of 2015 largely from representatives of the opposition .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
one of the most often shared pictures shows a prot@@ esters calling through the prot@@ ector : &quot; are you going to kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that tell of arguments , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
particularly large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves against the police and armed supporters of the government according to their own testimony .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic introduces the round , which forms the level of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office , which has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado state that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your minist@@ erial exercise !
on the road !
others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to make critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches increase more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike , instead of working or going shopping .

this is an adap@@ table version of an interview given by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was originally published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought that was okay .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , it is not noticeable that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who over the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started taking me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and invited me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you made yourself friends with one of the ERP .
don &apos;t worry that they will not kid@@ nap you one day and I will have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of Argentina &apos;s Revolutionary Workers Party .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me I would become Geh@@ ei@@ mag@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine , because so my father had educated me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

the prisoners are tortured ,
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I pe@@ eled in and saw a couch that people were tortured .
she looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch in it was terrible ... like a dirty no@@ dule .
years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing their eyes .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay facing down@@ wards - all were tied to their hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people stopped quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know this because my father told me at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors checked , the civilian Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , accused the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the path on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this route and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as it was called - was .
but when I was later to the military myself - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military badges that one accepts an enemy that has been fought .

but if you go to a house and steal the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could contribute to this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you , who steal the cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I will find you and surround you with hands .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do that !
this is how my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll kn@@ it pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing with home .
at that time the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator with this crime . I reci@@ proc@@ ated , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enforced disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I feel repentance .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed human beings during the dictatorship . but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses go away ?
why do children kid@@ nap ?
one day my father brought a girl with her mother , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people also not have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something always remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches for all the atro@@ cities I had to witness for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they supposedly defended were good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he only answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , let me show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I provided the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I have finally declared against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed by deaths in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
for crimes against humanity , 43 defend@@ ants were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .

all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Jud@@ gment is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the attorney of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but the investigation took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be erected there , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car drive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the photo was dissemin@@ ated in social media .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driving license last month witnessed a very particularly mis@@ used translation .
on a sign , the Japanese word was meant to be the &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ ling@@ sha ) , meaning &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with malicious thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible mot@@ orists . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from September 1 @-@ 20 on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it be so in such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the er@@ ron@@ eous English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture were ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News talked a little more about the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly people who have been involved in accidents across the country is quite a cause of concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this represents a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors dropped 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has declined overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors in the same period has increased .
the un@@ named re@@ porter brought comments to light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently prefer against older drivers :
the article on translation error , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So er@@ ron@@ eous is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are diverse .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge in order to understand the source text and to use active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers in the target language .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue , who could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , cost @-@ finding or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose knowledge of English is regarded as the best , is made available to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and mysterious movements that arise by machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English wor@@ dings in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more careful translations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto uses hopefully a more serious source for its translations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the Nav@@ al con Liber@@ ta@@ d portal ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later on , other users wrote that the internet sites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online tran@@ smit@@ ters also transferred footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups , who oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and had transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the link was sn@@ apped and recommended U@@ sers to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ ith : enable your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages are locked by Venezu@@ el@@ an providers .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO , VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro , later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible due to a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique that the DNS servers can correctly answer requests for certain domains .
when a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies er@@ ron@@ eous or den@@ ies the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ .net
with V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday 6 April when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was taken into custody .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV returned to the show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was 10 years old she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ an , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money hands over their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over his head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children will have to pay for the countless days of domestic work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that in the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced her .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated with the Cri@@ adi@@ s generally guarantees silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in the belief that they can conclude their training , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies his exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not be educated and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it until many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent impacts .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military unit Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ cket .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go responsible for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they referred the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozens of people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay than children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers it is much easier to off@@ end the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the fall .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be pointing out - if for the first time in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an history a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ a
the Cri@@ adi@@ tes are not only exploited as labour power , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón as the Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she also had time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers .
Friday , for example , clean@@ sed the refrigerator , pla@@ stered the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went back home and had time to learn .
the sooner she was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make supp@@ er for her employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve but did not have unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the house &apos;s library than food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings , the master of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and to read edi@@ t@@ orials from the opposition papers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them not to give faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak back to Guar@@ an@@ í home again at home .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed them to lose again , she explains .
but she was fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work .
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment to which Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ cket .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to go home . I didn &apos;t have friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships come into being , I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
society sanc@@ ti@@ fies the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hi ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland who wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the summary of the ad cre@@ pt again :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it .
thank you very much , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , as long as ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tes , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani , and the indigenous population were given tribute to them , and the system of the Mens@@ ú ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) and the native population went into a system of slavery where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill letters Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators regarding use and benefits of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is adopted by Parliament , users must register with a government authority in Egypt to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs over the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video teaching and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities will be able to impose the registration on the users . it is not clear how they should register those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Aman@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users who received a username and password from the Ministry of T@@ elecommunic@@ ation to get through the fire@@ wall which blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level all around Facebook . because of this , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Lead Research Techni@@ cian &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be approved as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislature and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its adoption and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no diver@@ ging nar@@ ration is present on the surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime involving a life @-@ long sentence for those who are found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; insti@@ gate to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish wildlife conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the war @-@ drawn Iraq
one of the rare Persian le@@ op@@ ards .

this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an Mountains in the northeast of Iraq , the animal rights activists H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the bigger family of the le@@ op@@ ards , who ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less prey .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
like Raz@@ a in the video , the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big predat@@ or .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video states that they have a record of a large cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she is also a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and advoc@@ ates that protected areas for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an area are set up .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the north @-@ east of Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a major pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami resulting from it .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring coun@@ ties Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappeared whole coastal towns from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was still experiencing a nuclear accident , already alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , what progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , 77 percent of planned spare @-@ homes ( for the off@@ springs , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light .
nevertheless , even six years after the disaster , ev@@ ac@@ uation of accommodation shel@@ ters ( for the off@@ lowers , cas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) ev@@ acu@@ ated into final replacement houses .
after the three @-@ fold disaster , almost 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , there were still more and more people living in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 per cent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated after the disaster were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by disaster , opened its doors again until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agriculture .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it feels more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to obtain an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation companies .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surve@@ yed find that still not enough in disaster prevention has been done .
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in her issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced her attention to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst disaster @-@ causing , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to witness .
almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture of 160@@ ,000 ev@@ ac@@ uation projects from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been moved to permanent spare @-@ homes .
after the 2017 state , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation districts in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old . they are known to fail because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .

when people meet people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater at first than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one is more connected than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in national demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student aged 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march nationwide .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors performed this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures there is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás acknowledged that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had suspended from active service to the conclusion of the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show police officers how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by an demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the network , where one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly afterwards rush to him .
another video with the same scenes but filmed from a different perspective is also sub@@ merged in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group was killed , only to crimin@@ alize teachers , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who was on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stick .
police gri@@ ps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which there was brutal police intervention against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers were in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators erected a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to pass through loudspeaker announcements to violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paolo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media has been pushing street protests by directing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paolo and Est@@ ado de S. Paolo specifically reported on a broken glass window to make a photo of their front pages illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a brand @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more on a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a particular cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot;

the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvesting on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after the earthquake , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the job .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ uting to the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve him of his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were received .
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
N@@ ene recalls to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore .
why has the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ atable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories producing sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the price of sugar increased over a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; Agricultural inspec@@ tors &quot; published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the closure of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
these were officially written documents , which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was delivered and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories still in operation , &quot; he says .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped construction .
with each part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important work place producer has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the jobs and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of those present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only high through grinding .

after two years , the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to mi@@ tig@@ ate it , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , which also dis@@ advant@@ aged other companies .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to visit other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production is not even serving the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ one harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies that one told him .
they torture him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into retirement at the age of 65 , not because it lacks strength , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered .

first Nations youths use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recording a song from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this via Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop starts with the fact that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspired by songs and videos in which the youngsters are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribal of the First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section of the street in Western Canada , where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is .
many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ anor@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go ahead of our youth
so they can do what they determined by the Creator
in the commentary piece , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( can be taken out of a typical Japanese restaurant ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan one can see plastic meals in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , they are displayed in the vicinity of the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; sculp@@ tural models of the dishes &quot; ) of any dish served in this restaurant .
the customers see themselves these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small companies producing the plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his movie Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them . a new trend , however , turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
with Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now available in special sales : new with plastic dishes decorated mobile phone bands as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ ku@@ hin &apos;s fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supply is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case an Em@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
some mobile tel@@ eph@@ ones and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ che@@ ating is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think I will be the only one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing way to un@@ pleasantly surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands of dried salmon .
other sc@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 3 .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project nar@@ rates the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not at all reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this fight ent@@ ails .
the reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ pse , behind every bone @-@ find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co called on the digital project &quot; Mak@@ ing a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learn to live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which should give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is searching secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews only one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we asked to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ sing a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the fra@@ gil@@ ity and the leadership of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of journalists and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensational journ@@ alism for some years now .
I pass the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book of crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this to be normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin insi@@ sts that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ action of people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; wat@@ ered . &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not touched and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you .
I asked myself in these horrible days whether wines would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was missing by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Council for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ portion@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this contribution and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is shown .
the check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something emerged the first time ? content in social media , whether true or false , tends to per@@ sist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and rav@@ aged it . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck was a victim .
officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a cinema nearby that was full of people watching the FIFA World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
an image with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; the U@@ gur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ fying scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years the same photo was taken several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened and what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters from the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses have reported drastically the atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo again , when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely link the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations describes those who could escape beaten , rape and several dead , some through burning .
while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared like the following , who brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page that fal@@ sely claimed that Myanmar &apos;s president &apos;s Th@@ ein had said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from DR Congo to depic@@ t this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not associated with it the image of DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false links go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reverse image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , others have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have included examples of abuse of abuse and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which page they were published . thus , we want to display the range more clearly than through the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also inter@@ connected ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .

the Myanmar government issued a correction to what it meant as &quot; intentionally fin@@ ed news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with respect to Myanmar . &quot;

this news site fal@@ sely asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar was admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the now deleted , the Catholic close to the message An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture came into circulation later in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links with Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the image of DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly being circul@@ ated by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this one in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a ho@@ ax .
from the embassy in which the picture was taken from DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ ine@@ ans mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dist@@ anced .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) Tin@@ Eye also points , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture ultimately carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Images
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence associated with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are ump@@ teen people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does it dimin@@ ish the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has already been widely deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
one argument is that the with@@ holding of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves .
at the same time , there is concern that violent images are des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers , and they have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ ented with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used either from the context or in a totally impro@@ per way .
however , any examination of false attri@@ butions should also take account of how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or impossible to translate at all .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ dom@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are necessary in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist chose &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird to focus on small languages .
the blog contains , for example , words from the Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s language @-@ lap language , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - P@@ aint yourself with your parents in recognition of how you care for your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they def@@ y other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words , showing how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ames the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ for@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have been tram@@ pled over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion from the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing due to the floods and mud av@@ al@@ an@@ ches .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence .
rainf@@ all took place on Saturday ( May 27 ) and the water levels in some areas slowly returned .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ all is already underway .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle too flooded due to the flo@@ wered water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five will be completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ eg@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Taxi Call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the App so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up of assistance and donations . these were then sent free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key that resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , provide security and aid to residents in need .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the restoration of normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
ladies in January I joined the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children . she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call still slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next , we adopt rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , others are gu@@ essing slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception .
they have to lim@@ b me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit in , will be Muslim .
to be lim@@ b @-@ li@@ zed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you get into the mind when you think of him ?
love ?
to be in peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western notion , the religion of Rum@@ i was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the story behind these images .
but these images stand out even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to dominate them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries over the last three decades , while the United States won &apos;t even vote for their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their scar@@ f in public buildings , and Saudi , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead the movements for change .
it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but am I now a major Muslim and American woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight far @-@ spread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated anti @-@ counter@@ fei@@ ting machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information which our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , has manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam hos@@ tility is more than just a stranger that tears the veil of a woman .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as Muslims , but to be a Muslim was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious lives , they rever@@ t to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim belief and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surge that I am Muslims when they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I weigh her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to the protection that would seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother on my mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; as they have decades ago winning a contest of Art of Fl@@ oral arrangements in Kar@@ achi .
it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted by Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who , for centuries , was col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name of Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .

belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an inevitably cried to his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family ruled by India in half a century , was not allowed to close his arms .
belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have all been &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first bomb bomb of history was dropped over a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir under@@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time since he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy eng@@ ages the United States and the susp@@ ects carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that , fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .

it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ sti@@ tions , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing two @-@ step &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this two @-@ day basis .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and were extended under President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer taking a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders towards people from just the countries it bom@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we carry and the bombs we throw on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , the Nor@@ th@@ western University scientists showed a scientifically wrong image and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims have the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are dar@@ ing to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous picture prints that we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences beyond the 1,7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was un@@ aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an un@@ tied Muslim .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and humans have been en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public image , four decades ago was even a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously , to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other . &quot; as the employment shows that we have a new future where we don &apos;t have a president who sp@@ ends chocolate cake while he already en@@ capsul@@ ated countries and &quot; other made people , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now , despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honor the diversity of languages of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
while listening often to &quot; listening to , &quot; these events are used instead &quot; to listen to , to appreciate , to touch . &quot;
in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers introduce their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devotion and their representation lead to the audience becoming involved .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotion as if language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ad takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the story of the rab@@ ble from Rab@@ bit and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his ability , John Ny@@ am@@ u@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story telling tours .
Puerto Rico calls for new fixing of sovereign debts by the US
with the aim of a re @-@ check of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which rose to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civi@@ c organizations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3 , 2017 ; the march launched in Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ana .
it was proclaimed by the group Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ uro @-@ examination of the debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos are demanding that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts must be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed remuneration that acts in favour of the economy .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the island - not included in the state alliance of the US - suffers from a severe financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ party non @-@ profit organization with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will run without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration wore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gil for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences in France , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publisher of books produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression .
it pays homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what is the true cost to which it is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side @-@ by @-@ side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to make some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted out of the register of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push@@ es him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , immediately .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process from temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; had taken Bass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and conditions remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Odessa , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment passes the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels was more pro@@ active than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture merg@@ es with local traditions and Persian influence .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture , which not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ fe in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public and scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet been able to complete this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dre@@ aming of freedom and pools taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ stitute that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens during each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your won@@ dro@@ us eyes ,
that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the prison &apos;s crush
and I will enter every detail of your voice and words
which I wear with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to bring back all the moments ,
and about your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bas@@ sels &apos;s history is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared since the protests in 2011 against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad .
those who were arrested or disappeared by the regime were tortured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique : convic@@ ted of corruption sentenced to previous post after release
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case where one member of the government returned to the state machine after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ o@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defend@@ ants on account of the distribution of 54 million me@@ tics ( about 800@@ ,000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for its rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic that submitted the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the firm did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many residents don &apos;t call the action good .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution supporting public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to resume the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have in@@ stituted a disciplinary action against the re@@ fut@@ able .
the company , however , apparently kept silent and did not indu@@ ce appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media of Moz@@ ambique , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; contradictory &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent guy , he would have been a consultant when he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it had been su@@ cked .
he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he could cause harm .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to be paid for his silence .
to be honest !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director is no mor@@ ale :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that he has insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the moral to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served in the state itself .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself was tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded in such a way .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in jail :
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , will not only be remembered as the first independent president for Moz@@ ambique , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral representations , when he energe@@ tically affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and free .
and today , the company , with which he is making money , sets him back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ru@@ le @-@ signed agreements ( @ az@@ a _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ a or spl@@ itting b@@ uns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dissip@@ ative con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ might normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for its use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ mes@@ isch is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ lower ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the phrase &quot; ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook should be more analytical before posting all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to fac@@ ebook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ its ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spreading hate speech , receive a rather good lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is time to cut off their nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who propag@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , and the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative way of writing the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was not allowed to read , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and don &apos;t consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here are some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not include hate speech , but were nevertheless removed :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to check out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should in addition heat violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for its failure to control the balancing Hass@@ an attacks on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running on context rather than concentrating on code and learned from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concluded with the chil@@ dr@@ ens &quot; marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice so that the legal age is now at 18 .
in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contracting partner of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , the min@@ ors as , every person under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that endea@@ vor@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring about this outcome .
nevertheless everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arise whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all .
but in early 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - in spite of 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which re@@ posted Les@@ lie An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : bill against the children &apos;s marriage was approved in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
after it has been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on child@@ care were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who dresses a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which veiled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth nearly every price .
while Abel was the opinion , it definitely took long enough to practice the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally coming :
public Status @-@ Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ all@@ - Thomas , saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Excell@@ ent news ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of marriage has been decre@@ ed .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
fo@@ al Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was :
the old age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years old regardless of the religious affili@@ ation .
the amend@@ ment to the am@@ ended legislation was approved today , June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who opposed the law voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Tax@@ marri@@ ages abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought against him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organisation in the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps should the law be passed , and he seems to release his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wished to act against the law , most social media users would like to address the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the issue so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply talk about that the state , our daughters in front of it , would be mis@@ used , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it &apos;s not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that they prohi@@ bit .
hack@@ ers rolls the office of the prosec@@ utor in front of national protests on the Russian National Day

on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ de with Russia &apos;s Day - the Russian National Day , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website was hack@@ ed by the district of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l . hack@@ ers have left a wit@@ ty message &quot; Rem@@ ain@@ ing at home .

the hack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; the Office of the Public Prosecutor invites the citizens to follow the pro@@ voc@@ ations and to keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;
at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the page - but it remained in the cache .
it &apos;s just gone
on Sunday morning the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day more clearly how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series resist the block@@ ade .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ ypass tools for blocked web pages ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN @-@ pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia , as described recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been taking place since 2007 , after the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several M@@ irr@@ ors pages ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now di@@ pped .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator machines ) , which does not support the system of domain names , making a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
despite legal prohibition , the content is available .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put all of the data from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed fashion .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italia has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Moz@@ illa in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
one acc@@ esses to another URL which is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia page , making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ h@@ len@@ se rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were vag@@ ue with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to take a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ a &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him with his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to crack pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he was already faced with Tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger cannot be bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was at home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ si@@ k appeared . he sits straight away , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for help &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .

years after the wedding , there are Indian women for the first time to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
in many parts of India , women avoid having the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by a sha@@ m court from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with his name .
the tradition of their wives also does not spread by name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer assignments to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , appeared to a unique club and were thus quickly become the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs , which exists in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign that is operated by the community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the degradation of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who do not name her hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the discussion on the patri@@ archy with a problem that women can easily identify with .
the name of their hus@@ bands does not speak lou@@ dly , is a custom that they have all du@@ ti@@ fully uph@@ eld and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband by the name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time , after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to put the discussion in motion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everybody , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she was sitting only in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to let out all the fru@@ stration of him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed at her she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less obvious and the situation ended in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ap@@ id red dot on the forehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zinc @-@ red point if he did it also .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely stopped , but think that they are now in a better position to choose for themselves not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we take a trip on every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties were tied to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things al@@ oud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ war Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code , the mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ tas into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next they decided to go on a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only done small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two still say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they realise that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .
the correspon@@ dents of the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community come from excluded groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news of those they themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and offer a hyper@@ local context to report global human rights and development challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first visit to Japan of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a day of commem@@ oration
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the Beat@@ les &apos; official YouTube channel .
on the 29th of June this year the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter Trend ( Beat@@ les Day ) , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , observed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have become quite clear that they had no choice but to welcome the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese variables had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language as English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day in Japan .
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ commemor@@ ative day .
we all love The Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it should be for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges sometimes cannot be whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ commemor@@ ative day .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .

bald men are kidn@@ apped and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia police warned the people that bald men in Moz@@ ambique could be the target of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald individuals for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border of Malawi .
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and in consequence they had been allowed to use the bodies of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a gl@@ atz@@ headed man could disclose gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC explained .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the U.@@ N. launched a mission in the South African country to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritual attacks , the Muslim police warned about the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ bands Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of In@@ ham@@ b@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this draws the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambique in Con@@ cord ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches .
in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed the chron@@ ic@@ le of the blo@@ gger poor S@@ nai@@ ppa on Facebook , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ ES GER@@ MAN E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , TH@@ IS ashamed A country in which people would have embarrass@@ ed to go to the streets , to offer sex against good marks , and to take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which people would not be ch@@ ased or bald for un@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; aimed to get to fast riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida &apos;s mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ eted that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ lier , as well as the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald :
Muslim authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald men .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects like Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding public access to the internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who had themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but they did not disclose any further information .
Bas@@ sels Sta@@ y and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we will pay tribute to all of Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer in the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations who have been working for his release in the past five years .
since 2011 and the start of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly displaced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have come to death in custody , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet China is still receiving calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have fully wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ arized some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway , Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his arrest , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union ( in German )
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision by which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she said in a statement on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
us in the USA
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; wish him the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as he helped him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June the message agency AF@@ P that the embassy request the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the US embassy sum@@ mon@@ ed a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s Foreign Ministry that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer to the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , based on Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

German government spokesperson , Steffen Sei@@ bert , wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Peking to the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the fuss surrounding Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um talks on :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release those per@@ pen@@ di@@ ous for exercising these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France , Germany
France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all the treatments he needs , regardless of where needed . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information about whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan , Taiwan
the Council of mainland matters in Taiwan requested China to release Li@@ u on June 27 and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u by the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with Li@@ u in an explanation on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosp@@ erous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state on an international scale .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the single Singapore political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that we are in the end not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of the fact that it appeared inevitably un@@ democratic .
by contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old guide appears again from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , abandoned the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , those in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he disgu@@ ised the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point where he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
as An@@ on publishes his commentary on the blog , he points out that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore is more a &quot; city &quot; than a country , he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections .
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement as the leader of an adol@@ escent generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this is properly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of grave importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but don &apos;t they defend their city ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who does our prime minister have to pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink employee ID ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and was always a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that &apos;s not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world being revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest install@@ ment of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , Editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most posed to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; I reply . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live now and again in Japan .
depending on the situation in which the conversation occurs , it is considered to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication mostly follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook in@@ war@@ dly in fur@@ y when they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t bother me .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if I &apos;d be confused with Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be idle - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tra@@ gically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would actually be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main property of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply a cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ od@@ ori@@ zes Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ des , which took power in 2014 and , in spite of their promises to restore civilian rule , still reign@@ s over the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ den Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girlfriend does .
although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times shared and received 8,@@ 800 list@@ ings .
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the position of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution granting the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army total decision making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program of &quot; setting up &quot; journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was also set up in the army which monitors online content and accused persons accused of slan@@ dering the monarchy .
Thailand relies heavily on &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ esty &quot; ( Maj@@ esty offensive ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the issues that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they are supposed to have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war society only re@@ covers very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sh@@ ab@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians have lived and worked together in the Soviet era .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and the Ab@@ ch@@ asen are living in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ sia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost@@ ly towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after having barely stepped up over a decade .
around 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district in 1989 .

the empty five @-@ floor blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ zh@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens which all served the community .
now there is only paved road with remaining magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have left the district by now .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty residents live .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
Chr@@ u@@ zh@@ kov@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago , an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Asia Min@@ or to live with her . &quot; my heart is forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts on supporting her young grand@@ children instead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .

Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child allowance for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now ha@@ stens to the ball scre@@ aming .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the damaged buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure in@@ security in their lives .
they don &apos;t know otherwise .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ ring in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the show@@ room there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , says Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , people are coming to full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to cry out : &quot; Mama Africa !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you Mama Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept out on boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication that they can &apos;t pay , she massages them with a bal@@ sam the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gurt beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel very comfortable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to reach Boston to find her husband and three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet them or to report on the course of their journey .
it declares that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the town leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar the night offered .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after living for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to people with his wife and three children who wanted to comp@@ ress money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and a stranger , a single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , travellers should consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who went away .
like a proud grand@@ dam she brow@@ ses in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair we@@ aving her a client has made , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , as she introduces me briefly .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; you have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang of Twitter users will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in Western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi have received a phone message in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaner &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the police communication , the app was informed that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with the min@@ ors &apos; filters is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , displaced ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( s ) , which publishes cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point when police inspec@@ tors random@@ ly checked whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
there is also a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which emerges that the software can up@@ lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electron@@ ical hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the directives of the City Council to minimize the distribution of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all branches of government , public authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are required to follow the Cyber@@ security Office &apos;s instructions to operate their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also referred to these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; by the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of U@@ rum@@ or &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible crime rates , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and discover that you are all alone in one place where everything has van@@ ished .
everything has gradually dis@@ b@@ anded and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable both from inside and outside .
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has fallen down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out for death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the earth is on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ ls . it becomes clear to you that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built for stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough so that I &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all quarters of the city cov@@ eted , but not my own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not set any high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; several times from my roof .
I heard my voice echo through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations and fulfilled it completely .
at such a moment you are aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed them all the way to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his eyes filled with water looked upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to look into my eyes and not on the floor ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put it in solitary and his father immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the con@@ tention of this cursed set lies in my nose till today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture that I had been subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I conc@@ ede all the details exactly before I enter the room .
different from that they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one single prisoner and must immediately set me up without waiting for permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried method of communication : beating the fist around the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first aid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similarly to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in total darkness there are no prominent facial features , and there are no doctors here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries are burning , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; allu@@ rement to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house here , which is no country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence in order to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me this way .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can start as much more important with your life than join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I &apos;ve got used to it , not to answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and strikes have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him yet , which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector before or if that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling down and did not find any favour in doing so , which is why he interven@@ ed as the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity f@@ lowed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my half naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two horrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me just like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sh@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must make himself terrible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had let me go .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he slides to his screen , sometimes to his computer , occasionally also to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ low@@ ye@@ en ( approximately : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and interro@@ gates their tried @-@ and @-@ tested opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not openly admit it , he has a special a@@ version against the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian Refu@@ gee of the second generation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; while he sho@@ cks Nes@@ café in water in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with age @-@ old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the swa@@ ths of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose talk in the first place of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to land in prison .
recently , the interior ministry Jord@@ ani@@ ens announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
the MP and former press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism which poses the old @-@ proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement may not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b drew back traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary Life &apos; has increased in Jordan - un@@ official out@@ war@@ dly .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it still appears that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be kept in prison for in@@ definite time , &quot; and for their release often a long @-@ term bureaucratic effort and the family guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to not shy away from issues that long considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music that is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was informed about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b is attacking the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse repe@@ ats a stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program , Ro@@ ya , to mem@@ ori@@ ze later that his comments were torn out of context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only one edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ova , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ der , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new anymore , that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices can be sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service set out several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , stating that they have critically responded to the problems linked with deep @-@ rooted corruption in social media .
in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs believes that only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will come closer to a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and artificial kinds of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes that .
until so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these large extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the ar@@ mo@@ ons , drums and dancing have been inv@@ aded over a thousand years and from a time when armies of the West mar@@ ched into the northeast to force the Indi@@ genous people of the region , the disciples , to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ san Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to take some great seats , so we have a great view .
it is difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I &apos;ve been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time now : two fixed @-@ cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ meter @-@ high fixed @-@ car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ians trade weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

external phenomena and personal care have rarely been as important as in this history , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the shore of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street cra@@ bs and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unparalleled demand for hair styles , which go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to Guer@@ illa fighters , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve has published .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel ej@@ ected ?
this is precisely the question of Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga &apos;s two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Bo@@ got@@ á Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation .
it was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace agreement with the F@@ ARC ( Revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way until one can speak about real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now re@@ integrate into life as civilians .
in turn , the Colom@@ bian society , accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now resume their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colum@@ bians could join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : by now thousands of young people have already written letters - messages of love to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter , who will then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more urgently .
he plans to share his love with people that needed the most urgent response this year .
this is how the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from Bo@@ got@@ á Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the F@@ ARC members set up as they did earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we had handed over the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL gren@@ ade laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has written something so beautiful in my life , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was tired of being the faithful companion of this struggle for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have only learned how to handle arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the beginning , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders gathered for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up when there was war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state has been affecting the whole Colum@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape the society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear those people who haven &apos;t yet heard and had no right to vote , and realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate , are only people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country is alive is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ vo , the arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , to rise and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we from the F@@ ARC are now relying on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror , activists have witnessed the recent months reporting on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs like a dam@@ ask compla@@ ining about the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not only come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q Legal Situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published which themati@@ zed the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ k@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspect qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender equality of their peasant women , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life , she moved to the United States in the long run .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove that shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App continued the lap .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to un@@ honor the family , you sweat ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had gotten everything together and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which nur@@ ses were you placed - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they told me absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by going up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that all was just evil , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has humili@@ ated not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother , and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car with dark window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 on it stood under the window .
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering , without notice , without knowing everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe me , you &apos;re in security only because you left the country ?
our people know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I actually try to figure out how to look at the person they remember from their past - that is , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have remained dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report in Washington .
for that I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan was barely able to wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end , they demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be very many .
if , then , above all those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to execute Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison were gone after their beard had grown .
since then there has been nothing new from them .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was there even when these people took part .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports about it yet . but we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the law of Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked up ; I had tin@@ ted lashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never even curved my hair .
there was a place in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny , where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ rot not on the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes in front of you , because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless - you could sense how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , suddenly looked at you with suspicion .
in the meantime I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ps , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t pay a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ per@@ ated refuge .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a router ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to prophes@@ y with foam before the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the cab@@ in@@ ers , which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think about transi@@ ent to men who love men and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in su@@ ici@@ des .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ asi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August reflected the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran which is dominated by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , such as Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube stuck the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority in August , and activists on site warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Tam@@ im - have been hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families on account of persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy over@@ took power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only receives little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi adolescents rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , Iranian General Director for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as officials and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country .
there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
faced with the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi must endure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women - who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments against me , why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , despite equal education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass blanket before or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still spread across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced that I suffer tw@@ o@@ fold and triple below .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to talk on skin colour , on black women , on black women , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used with racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but still all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to &quot; lift up their votes &quot; and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to argue that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are faced with black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin deserve less than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin colour to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman I can &apos;t join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refers both to the sex and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a sentim@@ ental and margin@@ alized being in historical regard .
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to promote their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to show white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women attempt to reward them for a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was established for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than to use me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that black women define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana may be : rec@@ la@@ iming : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and as a result of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to resolve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Alliance - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed , and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , poorly observed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed congregations to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
a group of women represents &quot; The crying women &quot; in order to express their pain of the women &apos;s mor@@ alities in the country and in the region and to show their rejection .

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by c@@ tural . the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ violent , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said their statement would be placed on the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s ac@@ ten@@ se ad did not use anything .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women have a complaint at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse it . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence are in general reported to the law enforcement authorities .
content 1 hits and statistics 2 invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that fails to enter@@ tain any Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation impacts and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports which , however , do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are al@@ arming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were filed for domestic violence with the District At@@ tor@@ ney General . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace courses . 86 % of women &apos;s ads appeared here as well .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used ; 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually reported . &quot; on every woman who reports in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will return to any woman who does not do so because of physical abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder is not an off@@ ence in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she had to leave . this was to regret it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would be victims of mal@@ treatment .
when I read about it , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on mal@@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she didn &apos;t leave Carlos for so long and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment had at least some complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made up of women who are all victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take seriously the statements of women .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case , everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she conducted a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os movement ( # Non @-@ F@@ ew ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d should declare and punish a stub@@ born criminal act as it is already the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the wording of the law was changed in some points , in order to also win the MPs for the law who feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be banned , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison .
the original bill intended to impose a large part of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence currently have to bear , if they simply want to reimbur@@ se adver@@ ts and receive a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ think must take place , so that violence can no longer be regarded as something normal .
who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the off@@ ender being punished .
we have to reimbur@@ se such a long indication that mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered . among other things , a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence was canc@@ eled .
opinions about the changes are coming apart .
the Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to be attacked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Israeli authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting of corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ ate .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he is serving a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important offices in the country : prime minister , Minister of Defence , Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , to limit and to torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists .
the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , even activists , to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closing and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported since its establishment in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces arrested I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , after an article titled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court in Oman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was sum@@ mon@@ ed from the Special Department and arrested on arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ an &apos;s arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any road , including online , was banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of violations of the public order , abuse of the Internet , and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of a violation of a ban on the public and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was found guilty of a year imprisonment and a fine of £ 1,000 ( $ 26@@ 00 ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the release of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Ha@@ j in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the Korean government .
on 8 January , the minister of information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of information personally signed a further statement , in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister once again obj@@ ected to the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to permit publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom in Oman has recently been viol@@ ated .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the site of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ain@@ ee of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j the impression arises that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that its journalists can pursue their work ;
3. protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ imp@@ eded and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit , non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association as well as the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with its agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or is not mentioned at all . it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) at the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the S@@ á@@ mi national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently launching a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gen .
GV : what do you think are important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a recipient rather than being a mate .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age classes .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space research , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
the system means that magazines only make articles available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports solutions to environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 types , such as Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ tons &apos;s work was limited by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding .
the patents g@@ aged not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as grain and cart@@ ons . plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security in the future of food production due to this trend .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding salad , but now it takes longer , since his work becomes more and more difficult due to the increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like a b@@ oul@@ der lying in a river to whom I have to herd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand before the courts no one can breed a new variety of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours to use no material protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station have bred and eaten red pipe let@@ tu@@ ce of the Out@@ standing Out@@ sh@@ ouse variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement comes from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) can be inspired by the free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders are allowed to agree that others can freely use the seed bred by them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately sp@@ it out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
som@@ ber prospects
for the retired professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and particip@@ ates in the ever @-@ increasing merg@@ ers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples are the amal@@ gam@@ ations of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available free of charge , as opposed to patent seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found that about a third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which means that it can be used either not or only difficult for plant breeders .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet available , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggests that large @-@ scale crops such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those , through which their taste or colour improves up to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the altered conditions due to climate change are much less predictable .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson , C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property put in place other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight already .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to stay : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their job easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features myself .
the plants form it themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures are required for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) owns patents , it is the majority of smaller seed companies to survive without patents either - either they reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for salads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that farmers would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected 20 years before competition , which makes it very easy to put it in my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , introduces an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet specific requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation Agre@@ em@@ l is working on an open @-@ source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( provisions for breeders differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i commitment cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , they oppose the current practice of the European Patent Office , which patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official start shot should be expected next year .
an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report . it represents the view that farmers must have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange it and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognise him .

human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained loyal to its goal , despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the freedom of opinion and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of site barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles he writes for websites and media not available for Egypt .
now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or apparatus of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with which also Zi@@ ada &apos;s blog is given a home , on the other hand is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting on the student protests and recording a video on how police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the lock @-@ up by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to block is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blo@@ gs of blo@@ gs may not be meaningful for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons from the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
now , however , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities locked up 133 pages from 24th May to 0@@ 6th of August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ let@@ at .
in addition , af@@ te documented the blocking of providers possible through the implementation of Internet cens@@ orship and private surf , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how to block websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering contents that could have access to Egyptian users .
the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed to court against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers report in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old has shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmac@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , na@@ vy and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published the editorial &quot; Das is not normal &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper like this :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what is happening in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a 4 @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t know the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , if distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police who only shoots and then asks questions to cover up .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira has argued that violence is a &quot; war . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning , as shown in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ency of public service .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro described as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; says C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , was also one of these security policy measures , with the aim of capturing a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police custody and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning this actually led to a decline in violent death cases . for some years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under attack after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux benefited from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; with which a civilian is an un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio will continue to suffer .
one week it is now time for the police to catch up the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : teach besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation ( PA@@ X ) and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b in a state of siege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly badly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , those areas controlled by rebel forces outside Damascus have been under siege , which led people to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the lon@@ gla@@ sting block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and acade@@ mics teaches Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as residents how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria and are extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said AF@@ P to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can grow in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organisers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it has become more and more known . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to teach 125 families to grow mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article they have achieved more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel shor@@ tages , locally made plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fungi all over East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach humans the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
dis@@ sem@@ ination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , who are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea across the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many regional capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the week before in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of the forest of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called out a national highway out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires have also been registered in Gali@@ cia in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks covering the northern and central regions of the country , reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

the Rem@@ ov@@ able Trage@@ dy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire prevention measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to reduce the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Bund der farmers of Portugal stated the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which permitted the construction activity of case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val passes on in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily flamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to the fires of this species .
these problems include the website of the Civil Defence website of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when residents sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the fire bri@@ gade work and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires .

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

in one night in the fall of 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defeated by the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government , and Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
exactly at this time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan , sat together for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say so , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe never again .
at dawn the boy was to burst open .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .

CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt vulnerable .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . work was difficult and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself to earn his living .
at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating . we suspended nylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af had left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ k was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high twin quot@@ as , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions applying asylum seekers in the country are disa@@ strous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to an admission centre if they officially granted a request for asylum - which can be extended for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either reli@@ ant on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
and so it happened .
but his un@@ bo@@ unded li@@ festy@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions .
after having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis &quot; success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian lux@@ uries - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans have been created , including tailor shops , travel agents , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea for his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff mostly are refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also are Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail , and aim to return to the country he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packing and conservation techniques . &quot; this way they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ k made this trip herself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen Report : Egypt &apos;s draft bill on social networking Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , has been in jail for more than 900 days .
he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot showing challenges , wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that fores@@ ees users to use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
users would have to register in order to use social networks within six months of submitting a bill of law on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who neglect this step may be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or a penalty of pen@@ alties .
the law , which was adverti@@ sed by sixty members of the parliament , is currently presi@@ ded over by the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another MP submitted a legislative proposal to introduce stric@@ ter pen@@ alties for insul@@ ting the President or a senior official .
under the law proposition , however , such a crime would be pun@@ ishable by prison and fin@@ es , according to legal experts from the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took pictures of violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the release of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
as more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan had four years in prison for a court date .
recently his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th May , because the prison administration failed , according to human rights groups , to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan faces death penalty as a result of one , so many human rights groups agree that exposure to weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a released the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
interro@@ gate Tunisi@@ an activists to peer @-@ reviewed documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founded the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , endor@@ ses a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , if they return all un@@ law@@ fully preserved funds .
the document , published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the Pres@@ idential plans look to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined the nam@@ ing of his sources , stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which journalists granted the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their IDs ?
according to new regulations of the Information Office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media .
in addition , it is stated in the rules that the registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved . it is still unclear how authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do you see us in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat tran@@ spi@@ red to register with the state government as an &quot; organizer of the distribution of information . &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government is carrying out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make written services for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data .
these websites include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications said that the site was blocked because it became &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to insti@@ gate a political barrier campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week &apos;s backed documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install a backdoor , de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation is still ongoing until May 19th . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
