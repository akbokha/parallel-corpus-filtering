<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American writers and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me, that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous plot of an oil magnet that wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it, as if it is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country I have ever lived, its diversity so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks of the mountain with his opinion, as one says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in favor of him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in Republican primaries was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't bring Trump and his voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply religious person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trump Weltanschauung agreed not with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mps Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced with Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment for her lifetime, and to her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump was making his way to nominated Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a foothold and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white men, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of them know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (hm. Ü): as much as "white vs. all other ethnicities"; white-white pun-play against whites and whiplash, as the big Van Jones called, has exactly killed what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "" "" "" "Mr. Khan asked." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "they shouted and their voices got louder." "" "</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "would anyone not be like you, a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "" "" "NO" "" "" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son was pleased sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "this is now Trump Land," "" "" "" "said the message." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that is breaking my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From misery to the stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love of music by rubbish</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province have in common with the children of the Paraguaean town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with rubbish</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian's English newspaper wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group seriously, writes the local press notcias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and playing with shining eyes and playing in the bustle you learn to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located virtually at the top of the largest landfill of Asunción in Paraguays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments, made of local solid waste materials, is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all of which were made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in The Los Angeles Times, Flavio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash The children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio was something he had never seen before: a violin-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-release occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa at that time it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the waters of Liberia, before it searched the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were upset by this and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "" "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was unable to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia for pillaging fish stocks in the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network, alongside Somalia and Madagascar, are the six countries that then expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"this way we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and interact with each other where illegal fishing is concerned," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support for FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By ignoring existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while action against illegal fishing was once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with which information circulated between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also carefully tracks the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to flag ships which fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they may even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer financially worthwhile." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "" "" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "" "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenues, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, imaginary names, fishing-protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an incomplete control system," "" "" "" "said Long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "but another country could say" "" "" "" "Come to me" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 suspicions of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i locate suspicious ships more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal boats they like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their positions," says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers technical support for FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so that they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find discriminatory ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Worldwatch together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization: a platform that offers satellite data and is able to display the position of each tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also scare them off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which previously fished without a license and had hardly to reckon with consequences, now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have a 33% increase in fishing net sales since fishing boats have bought more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors were on board towing nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "" "" "says Kiilu." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries joined the West Africa Task Force in 2015. now they are fighting illegal fishing, exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With security, the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used trawl nets which are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also entered into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world.

<seg id="152">Her articles are published in Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and The Guardian. situation in Venezuela continues to escalate: demonstrations in several cities with the goal of "conquering the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's office.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government had rejected Venezuela's request for a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country were running, reacted by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (e.g.: the regression of Venezuela) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being held in other parts of the country, including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally located federal state Carabobo and at the Isla Margarita in Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation deteriorates continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the ministerial exercise of the current president Nicolás Maduro; in the end, however, the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributors to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows in her latest article:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and profit rate are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine is concerned, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (roughly: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together, called on the demonstrators to participate in the elections of 2015 largely from representatives of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="170">The first demonstration in the framework of the action programme "The reconquest of Venezuela" took place on Wednesday, 26 October.</seg>
<seg id="171">The images of the marches published in real time testify, among other things, an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country, but also confrontations with policemen and supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">One of the most often shared pictures shows a protesters calling through the protector: "are you going to kill me, because I am hungry?"</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images that tell of arguments, as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves against the police and armed supporters of the government according to their own testimony.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean State of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts, because otherwise one could see something that many National Guards do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic introduces the round, which forms the level of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office, which has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs added:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado state that 1% of signatures are fake.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your ministerial exercise!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which, from their point of view, has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to make critical voices silent:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches increase more and more in frequency and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="192">Some Venezuelans reported the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike, instead of working or going shopping.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adaptable version of an interview given by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was originally published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, it is not noticeable that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I couldn't realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Filing of records.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who over the years recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started taking me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him "Kent."</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong his driving license last month witnessed a very particularly misused translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign, the Japanese word was meant to be the "older motorists" (koreilingsha), meaning "older motorists," wrongly - but perhaps also with malicious thoughts & # 8212; as "terrible motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from September 1-20 on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "how could it be so in such an English translation?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "this is an insult to elderly people and an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "" "" "said Holmes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The erroneous English translation was first removed. the term "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the appropriate "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture were apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "" "" "said the police." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News talked a little more about the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly people who have been involved in accidents across the country is quite a cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this represents a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors dropped 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has declined overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors in the same period has increased.</seg>
<seg id="366">The unnamed reporter brought comments to light in the version of the article published on Yahoo, which show what prejudices some Japanese apparently prefer against older drivers:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge in order to understand the source text and to use active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers in the target language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue, who could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for translating, cost-finding or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose knowledge of English is regarded as the best, is made available to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and mysterious movements that arise by machine translation show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English wordings in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more careful translations.</seg>

<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship measures on the internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the Naval con Libertad portal (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later on, other users wrote that the internet sites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also transferred footage of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups, who oppose the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and had transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the link was snapped and recommended Users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenith: enable your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages are locked by Venezuelan providers.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the side of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezolans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I signed up again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO, VEsinfiltro, later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible due to a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique that the DNS servers can correctly answer requests for certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">When a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server replies erroneous or denies the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNA lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplay.net</seg>
<seg id="408">With VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday 6 April when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV returned to the show.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes Venezuelans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children will have to pay for the countless days of domestic work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that in the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced her.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated with the Criadis generally guarantees silence.</seg>

<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cricket.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted practice of the Criadazgo responsible for the death of the girl in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They referred the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozens of people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital of Asunción as the Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she also had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday, for example, cleansed the refrigerator, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make supper for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve but did not have unlimited food. "I was allowed to fetch more books from the house's library than food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings, the master of the house Alvarenga forced to stand beside him and to read editorials from the opposition papers like "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince them not to give faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the master had found someone who listened while talking about politics," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn" bad habits "there again." so they thought that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of Guarani, would speak back to Guaraní home again at home.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed them to lose again, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them, with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about is bullying and harassment to which Criaditas are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cricket.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to go home. I didn't have friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, at the time when friendships come into being, I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group.</seg>

<seg id="482">The administrator of the group is Pepa Kostianovsky, a city councillor in the Asunción district.</seg>
<seg id="483">Hi! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="496">(Criaditas, as long as?), a collection of testimonies of former Criadites, writes Ortiz:</seg>
<seg id="497">In the course of our history we have managed to abolish systems such as slavery, cuñadazgo (a practice from the early history of Paraguay), where the Spanish Conquistadores, the Conquistadores, the women of Guarani, and the indigenous population were given tribute to them, and the system of the Mensú (where the workers were treated as semi-slaves) and the native population went into a system of slavery where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fines.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, which runs over the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice, video teaching and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities will be able to impose the registration on the users. it is not clear how they should register those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "Lead Research Technician") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>

<seg id="519">Whether its adoption and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximized and ensured that no diverging narration is present on the surface," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="524">This post by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the Kurdistan Mountains in the northeast of Iraq, the animal rights activists Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the bigger family of the leopards, who roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus Saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video, the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video states that they have a record of a large cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza passionately shows a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, she is also a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and advocates that protected areas for wild animals in the Kurdistan area are set up.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the north-east of Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a major prefecture in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami resulting from it.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring counties Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had disappeared whole coastal towns from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture was still experiencing a nuclear accident, already alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, what progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, 77 percent of planned spare-homes (for the offsprings, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the disaster, evacuation of accommodation shelters (for the offlowers, casetsu juchaku) evacuated into final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold disaster, almost 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, there were still more and more people living in Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuated after the disaster were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by disaster, opened its doors again until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three prefectures of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land from Fukushima are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers, it feels more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation companies.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in disaster prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reinforced her attention to the situation of the evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness to the worst disaster-causing, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to witness.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture of 160,000 evacuation projects from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been moved to permanent spare-homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 state, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuation districts in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old. they are known to fail because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student aged 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors performed this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures there is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stick. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás acknowledged that Sampaio had suspended from active service to the conclusion of the investigation of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show police officers how he strikes in Goiânia with his baton on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by an demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a media activist from Goiânia, distributed the video recorded by Luiz da Luz in the network, where one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics shortly afterwards rush to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes but filmed from a different perspective is also submerged in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 euros) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiânia while lying in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group was killed, only to criminalize teachers, and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who was on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a policeman who struck him with a stick.</seg>

<seg id="616">Police officers were in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators erected a stage for orators, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to pass through loudspeaker announcements to violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paolo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media has been pushing street protests by directing the focus on another, unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paolo and Estado de S. Paolo specifically reported on a broken glass window to make a photo of their front pages illustrative.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a brand-set bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more on a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a particular cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" obtains an absurd, disproportionate significance, and the typical violence of the military police is covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The detoxification of forgotten villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso legislation, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The local community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the earthquake, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who stands up every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive him of his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are back in operation after a long inactive period because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why has the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbeatable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production goal was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories producing sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the price of sugar increased over a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report "Agricultural inspectors" published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If present production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will certainly go into history," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the closure of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeated is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they constituted a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially written documents, which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to mitigate it, they also stopped asphalting the road, which also disadvantaged other companies.</seg>

<seg id="692">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this via Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop starts with the fact that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance" or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspired by songs and videos in which the youngsters are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribal of the First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section of the street in Western Canada, where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapanoroostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the Strophe is available in transcript as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go ahead of our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they determined by the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary piece, the reader and advocate of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse to syllabus (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see plastic meals in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, they are displayed in the vicinity of the shokuhin sanpuru (the "sculptural models of the dishes") of any dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see themselves these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small companies producing the plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his movie Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them. a new trend, however, turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">With Naver matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now available in special sales: new with plastic dishes decorated mobile phone bands as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shokuhin's fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supply is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an Emen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile telephones and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon-cheating is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "" "" "there is someone who would say:" "" "" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think I will be the only one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing way to unpleasantly surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other scurrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # 3.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not at all reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this fight entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind every bone-find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político called on the digital project "Making a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learn to live with drug trafficking"), which should give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership of the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of journalists and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensational journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass the newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook of criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin insists that he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he's big. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were "watered."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not touched and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of blackmail in the main city district: how a family was plundered with threats."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these horrible days whether wines would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was missing by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizens Council for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "apportiona Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the year after something emerged the first time? content in social media, whether true or false, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This wrong coupling of picture and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker traversed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and ravaged it. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck was a victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a cinema nearby that was full of people watching the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">An image with the title "That is Nigeria." the Ugur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrifying scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was taken several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened and what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters from the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses have reported drastically the atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "no one was left to count bodies," "" "" "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo again, when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely link the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations describes those who could escape beaten, rape and several dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against Rohingya, posts appeared like the following, who brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page that falsely claimed that Myanmar's president's Thein had said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from DR Congo to depict this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last accessed on 26 April 2017, can be called here.</seg>

<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still contained in it.</seg>

<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered for the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Chinese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message allegedly being circulated by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums such as this one in Vietnamese and declared it a hoax.</seg>

<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the crawler and occasionally they have image data in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010, the picture ultimately carries a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and Images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (frames) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence associated with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are umpteen people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and does it diminish the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has already been widely debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the withholding of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, there is concern that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers, and they have the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimented with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used either from the context or in a totally improper way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any examination of false attributions should also take account of how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. unsurpassable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or impossible to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsurpassable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sodoma).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are necessary in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist chose "untranslatable" Steven Bird to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">The blog contains, for example, words from the Vanuatu's language-lap language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "" "" "- Paint yourself with your parents in recognition of how you care for your younger years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness you feel after being warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defy other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>

<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which usually starts at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilfora and Attanagalu Oya have been trampled over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">According to an opinion from the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing due to the floods and mud avalanches.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence.</seg>
<seg id="974">Rainfall took place on Saturday (May 27) and the water levels in some areas slowly returned.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flooding catastrophe:</seg>
<seg id="977">Floods in Tawalama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates on the flood situation.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of this, consciously and unconsciously, to solidify the "other." as the employment shows that we have a new future where we don't have a president who spends chocolate cake while he already encapsulated countries and "other made people," goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now, despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unsurpassable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and honor the diversity of languages of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While listening often to "listening to," these events are used instead "to listen to, to appreciate, to touch."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers introduce their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation lead to the audience becoming involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotion as if language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, storyteller Rassidatou Konad takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the story of the rabble from Rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his ability, John Nyamuara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story telling tours.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for new fixing of sovereign debts by the US</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-check of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which rose to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civic organizations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3, 2017; the march launched in Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juana.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda (civic front for the neuro-examination of the debt) and the ecumenical church meeting of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of re-fixing the debt also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos are demanding that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts must be held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed remuneration that acts in favour of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico are refusing to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, dedicated itself to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences in France, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publisher of books produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available royalty-free, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It pays homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what is the true cost to which it is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side-by-side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to make some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the register of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" had taken Bassel on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and conditions remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Odessa, a designer, technologist and at the moment passes the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels was more proactive than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture merges with local traditions and Persian influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strife in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public and scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet been able to complete this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and pools taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prostitute that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: convicted of corruption sentenced to previous post after release</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case where one member of the government returned to the state machine after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Dioino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants on account of the distribution of 54 million metics (about 800,000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for its reinstatement to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic that submitted the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to return to his old post, as the firm did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents don't call the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution supporting public transparency, condemned the company's decision to resume the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle.</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system," "" "" "" "the CIP." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have instituted a disciplinary action against the refutable.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company, however, apparently kept silent and did not induce appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the social media of Mozambique, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as "contradictory":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would have been a consultant when he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it had been sucked.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he could cause harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">To be honest!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director is no morale:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that he has insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the moral to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served in the state itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself was tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was rewarded in such a way.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "" "" "Facebook censored the word" "" "" "" "Kalar" "" "" "" "or" "" "" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely dissipative connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar'might normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for its use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings which have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmesisch is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting blower), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalaraar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase "ku la -" cure "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook should be more analytical before posting all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "" "" "Kalar" "" "" "" "manually." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write to facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splits).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, spreading hate speech, receive a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now it is time to cut off their nationalism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who propagates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, and the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative way of writing the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word "Kalar" is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was not allowed to read, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "" "" "moreover, it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and forbidden such words as" "" "" "" "stool" "" "" "" "or" "" "" "" "pea curry" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided for a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and don't consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here are some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not include hate speech, but were nevertheless removed:</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should in addition heat violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for its failure to control the balancing Hassan attacks on his Burmese pages.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the parliament of the country unanimously approved a law to ban this practice so that the legal age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">In May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere since that, age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contracting partner of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the minors as, every person under 18 years of age. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that endeavored to abolish laws for children's marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about saying the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arise whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the bill against the children's marriage was decided - in spite of 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave a status update on Facebook, which reposted Leslie Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: bill against the children's marriage was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After it has been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on childcare were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who dresses a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which veiled the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth nearly every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was the opinion, it definitely took long enough to practice the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally coming:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status-Update on Facebook by Lara Quentall- Thomas, saying: "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" Excellent news! "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law of marriage has been decreed.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, Voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Foal Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group, who openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The old age in Trinidad and Tobago is now 18 years old regardless of the religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The amendment to the amended legislation was approved today, June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present during the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all deputies who opposed the law voted for the law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # Taxmarriages abuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who fought against him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">However, a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, Secretary General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most well-known Hindu organisation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj announced his intention to take judicial steps should the law be passed, and he seems to release his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wished to act against the law, most social media users would like to address the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the issue so broadly, in a way that can only cause panic and disgrace, if we, instead of talking about the problem, would simply talk about that the state, our daughters in front of it, would be misused, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it's not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that they prohibit.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers rolls the office of the prosecutor in front of national protests on the Russian National Day</seg>
<seg id="1383">Screen print of the message posted on Sunday at the Yaroslavl district's website.</seg>
<seg id="1384">On the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coincide with Russia's Day - the Russian National Day, the prosecutor's website was hacked by the district of Yaroslavl. hackers have left a witty message "Remaining at home.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"" "" "" "or we take you to the jail instead of Dimon." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1386">The hackers posted the YouTube video "He is not a Dimon for you" on the prosecutor's website with the following comment: "the Office of the Public Prosecutor invites the citizens to follow the provocations and to keep away from all non-sanctioned events!"</seg>
<seg id="1387">At 11.15 the message was removed from the page - but it remained in the cache.</seg>
<seg id="1388">It's just gone</seg>
<seg id="1389">On Sunday morning the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service YarNews that they were hacked.</seg>
<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day more clearly how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using bypass tools for blocked web pages (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN-prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia, as described recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been taking place since 2007, after the internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several Mirrors pages (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are now dipped.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator machines), which does not support the system of domain names, making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Despite legal prohibition, the content is available.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put all of the data from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed fashion.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italia has both tr.vikiansicyclopedi.org, a Mirrorseite from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar Mirrorsites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrai - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses to another URL which is not the original. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia page, making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlense rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were vague with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to take a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepta's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town right next to Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started to crack pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he was already faced with Tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was at home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the busik appeared. he sits straight away, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for help" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent in the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid having the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "" "" "instead, they use a pronoun or say" "" "" "" "father of my child." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a sham court from the Indian state of Odisha and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with his name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also does not spread by name, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer assignments to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, appeared to a unique club and were thus quickly become the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which exists in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign that is operated by the community Video Volunteers and advocates the degradation of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paz has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who do not name her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the discussion on the patriarchy with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The name of their husbands does not speak loudly, is a custom that they have all dutifully upheld and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband by the name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time, after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to put the discussion in motion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "" "" "then she asked everybody," "" "" "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was sitting only in front of herself during the whole exercise; another decided to let out all the frustration of him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an ancient tradition, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared at her she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "another woman said," "" "" "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less obvious and the situation ended in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinapid red dot on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinc-red point if he did it also.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but think that they are now in a better position to choose for themselves not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we take a trip on every discussion club." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear something," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months, for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities were tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things aloud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salwar Kurta, a wide shirt over trousers; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code, the morals connected with the Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Kurtas into a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to go on a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only done small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they realise that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1547">The Beatles in their landing in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1548">Screenshot of the Beatles' official YouTube channel.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On the 29th of June this year the Hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter Trend (Beatles Day), where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit to the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered a turnaround in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in 1964 in London, observed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have become quite clear that they had no choice but to welcome the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese variables had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language as English," Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles commemorative day in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles-commemorative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love The Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is supposed to represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it should be for fans, Japanese also make pilgrimages to the well-known places connected with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald individuals for organ trafficking, probably for superstitious purposes, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border of Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found decapitated and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and in consequence they had been allowed to use the bodies of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is a local superstition that the head of a glatzheaded man could disclose gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC explained.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the U.N. launched a mission in the South African country to examine this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who plan to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to kahle men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks, the Muslim police warned about the latest killings of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husbands Algy Adamo, student and resident of Inhambe in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans, this draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique in Concord (PRM), which also indicates that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha distributed the chronicle of the blogger poor Snaippa on Facebook, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHES GERMAN EIN Mosambique, THIS ashamed A country in which people would have embarrassed to go to the streets, to offer sex against good marks, and to take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which people would not be chased or bald for unbelieving purposes or "black magic" aimed to get to fast riches.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some missed the opportunity for macabre humor.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida's machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user, tweeted that both the chief of the district Morrumbala, Pedro Saplier, as well as the police spokesman Zambézias, Inácio Dina, are both bald:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1633">Yet China is still receiving calls from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have fully wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway, Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his arrest, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union (in German)</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision by which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as she said in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Lius wife and family members." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1651">Us in the USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans "wish him the opportunity for treatment abroad, in so far as he helped him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on 27 June the message agency AFP that the embassy request the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US embassy summoned a furious response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Ministry that "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer to the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, based on Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany (in German)</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, wrote on July 3, Berlin hopes that Liu "gets all the medical support he needs," and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Peking to the Reuters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the fuss surrounding Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China called on China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP previously that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum talks on:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release those perpendious for exercising these rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, Germany</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo gets all the treatments he needs, regardless of where needed. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information about whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of mainland matters in Taiwan requested China to release Liu on June 27 and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu by the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned with Liu in an explanation on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected people, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state on an international scale.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the single Singapore political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that we are in the end not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of the fact that it appeared inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">By contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old guide appears again from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, abandoned the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, those in the last week of Shanmugam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised the corresponding questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point where he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">As Anon publishes his commentary on the blog, he points out that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is more a "city" than a country, he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "" "" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "" "" "no country," "" "" "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, which makes such a polemical statement as the leader of an adolescent generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am very embarrassed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this is properly associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "" "" "Mr Shanmugam" "" "" "" "did Mr Shanmugam" "" "" "" "commit a mistake" "" "" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of grave importance.</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification mostly follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians cook inwardly in fury when they are kept for Americans, but don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1768">First, to be called "nice" means to be idle - just like the good-natured, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would actually be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing, if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main property of the Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band famous in Thailand released a music video that the Junta parodes, which took power in 2014 and, in spite of their promises to restore civilian rule, still reigns over the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phaden Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what precepts his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video is indirectly related to the military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,254 times shared and received 8,800 listings.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially how it behaves with the position of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was also set up in the army which monitors online content and accused persons accused of slandering the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society only recovers very slowly in East-Abchasia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-Abchassic war officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharshabava are located in the coal-basin of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Asia-Asia, Georgians and Armenians have lived and worked together in the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and the Abchasen are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchsia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghostly towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has amounted to 16,000 people after having barely stepped up over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Around 43,000 people lived in this district in 1989.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillenframe and gold-coloured earring in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the showroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Mrs. Ramírez, people are coming to full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to cry out: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">"" "" "" "where are you Mama Africa?" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept out on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication that they can't pay, she massages them with a balsam the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yogurt beard) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "" "" "he answered with a smile." "" "" "" "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">"" "" "" "we feel very comfortable here." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to reach Boston to find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already talking about Ms. Ramírez on Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave her again," "" "" "" "he says smiling." "" "" "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez told her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet them or to report on the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the town leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for a dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "" "" "there are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After living for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to people with his wife and three children who wanted to compress money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and a stranger, a single educator, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, travellers should consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud granddam she browses in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair weaving her a client has made, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, as she introduces me briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya'fueron," she repeats every time. "you have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"" "" "" "a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang of Twitter users will be" "" "" "" "" s "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1961">Residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in Western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, mobile users in the Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi have received a phone message in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaner").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "" "" "preventing access to terrorist information" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the police communication, the app was informed that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors' filters is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, displaced ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (s), which publishes censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint when police inspectors randomly checked whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There is also a Jingwang product description from which emerges that the software can uplift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronical handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the directives of the City Council to minimize the distribution of illegal content." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, public authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are required to follow the Cybersecurity Office's instructions to operate their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also referred to these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" by the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumor's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible crime rates, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2034">Then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I concede all the details exactly before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Different from that they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share it with only one single prisoner and must immediately set me up without waiting for permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I resorted to an old-tried method of communication: beating the fist around the wall.</seg>

<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me that they would release him if I remain.</seg>

<seg id="2064">In punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices at your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold back your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough for him yet, which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator had worked as a garbage collector before or if that belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them alternated while I was still in line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noted the cooling down and did not find any favour in doing so, which is why he intervened as the next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed through my whole body, enough to supply my whole district.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emslam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slides to his screen, sometimes to his computer, occasionally also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fellowyeen (approximately: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and interrogates their tried-and-tested opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not openly admit it, he has a special aversion against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as a "Palestinian Refugee of the second generation."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "" "" "says Hdaib." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a man," while he shocks Nescafé in water in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with age-old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent-cigarette in the nose talk in the first place of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the interior ministry Jordaniens announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism which poses the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib drew back traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'Honorary Life' has increased in Jordan - unofficial outwardly.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings in 2016 reached its peak; however, it still appears that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be kept in prison for indefinite time," and for their release often a long-term bureaucratic effort and the family guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is well-known to not shy away from issues that long considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music that is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "I was informed about politics," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "" "" "in a song called" "" "" "" "Edward Sa'd" "" "" "", "Hdaib is attacking the question of Palestinian identity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse repeats a strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordanian online program, Roya, to memorize later that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only one edited version," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuova, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuder, who was later to work on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou's Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new anymore, that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices can be silenced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service set out several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, stating that they have critically responded to the problems linked with deep-rooted corruption in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs believes that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will come closer to a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificial kinds of democracies. at least, he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until so far, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman was a student of Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These large extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the armoons, drums and dancing have been invaded over a thousand years and from a time when armies of the West marched into the northeast to force the Indigenous people of the region, the disciples, to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebsan Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to take some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is difficult to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time now: two fixed-cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # Nebuchafestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of an 18-meter-high fixed-car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">External phenomena and personal care have rarely been as important as in this history, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the shore of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima's capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street crabs and illegal drug trafficking are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences rising demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens go into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hair styles, which go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district, where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to Guerilla fighters," which the international online magazine Tea After Twelve has published.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel ejected?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of Leonardo Párraga's two young Colombian activists from the Bogotá Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="2186">It was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Colombians, there is still a long way until one can speak about real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now reintegrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In turn, the Colombian society, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now resume their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians could join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: by now thousands of young people have already written letters - messages of love to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people that needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">This is how the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from Bogotá Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set up as they did earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," said the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had handed over the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL grenade launcher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "I answered," "" "" "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "" "" "he answered," "" "" "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "no one has written something so beautiful in my life, so I answer it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was tired of being the faithful companion of this struggle for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "until now I have only learned how to handle arms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some of the FARC leaders gathered for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up when there was war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state has been affecting the whole Columbian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape the society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "said one of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear those people who haven't yet heard and had no right to vote, and realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate, are only people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country is alive is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalvo, the archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, to rise and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we from the FARC are now relying on peace, on a policy without weapons." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With terror, activists have witnessed the recent months reporting on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a damask complaining about the local LGBTQ community has not only come about overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ Legal Situation in Chechnya has taken the international headlines several months ago after reports have been published which thematized the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milkina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspect queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>

<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt she was a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had learned about the gender equality of their peasant women, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Out of fear for her life, she moved to the United States in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While trying to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can remove that shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents through WhatsApp continued the lap.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "" "" "how long do you still want to unhonor the family, you sweat?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had gotten everything together and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurses were you placed - in which of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They told me absurd demands: some told me that I must prove it by going up without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex that all was just evil, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has humiliated not only your family but the entire republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "" "" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother, and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car with dark window panes and a number plate with a 95 on it stood under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without notice, without knowing everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe me, you're in security only because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">We don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually try to figure out how to look at the person they remember from their past - that is, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have remained dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For that I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan was barely able to wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end, they demand proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to execute Kadyrow's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "" "" "say:" "" "" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or a military base." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison were gone after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Since then there has been nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was there even when these people took part.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports about it yet. but we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "Russia originally wanted to lead us to" "" "" "" "civilisation" "" "" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the law of Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked up; I had tinted lashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia has never even curved my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">There was a place in front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny, where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Sprot not on the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes in front of you, because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could sense how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before, suddenly looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreps, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't pay a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I apperated refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a router?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to prophesy with foam before the mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which, the cabiners, which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about transient to men who love men and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicides.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jasim Moramazi on 27 August reflected the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran which is dominated by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, such as Ahrazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube stuck the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to erase the flames, and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwa.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ahrazi minority in August, and activists on site warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights announced that some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Tamim - have been hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families on account of persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwa was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy overtook power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahrazi-Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams, the water from the Arab areas in the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi adolescents rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, Iranian General Director for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahrazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affiliation to the Ahrazi and be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Faced with the circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi must endure, human rights activist alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women - who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments against me, why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite equal education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass blanket before or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still spread across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I suffer twofold and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to talk on skin colour, on black women, on black women, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused with racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside of the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But still all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to "lift up their votes" and "Kumbaya, my Lord" to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to argue that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist violence that we are faced with black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin deserve less than white men and women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin colour to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman I can't join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refers both to the sex and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a sentimental and marginalized being in historical regard.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to promote their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to show white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women attempt to reward them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of the Womanism, which was established for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than to use me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that black women define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana may be: reclaiming: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and as a result of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither bypassed nor ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by ctural. the article is part of the series # PorserMujer (# weilicheinefraubin) reported about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-violent, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said their statement would be placed on the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena because of mistreatment, Ada Báez's actense ad did not use anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women have a complaint at all, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse it. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence are in general reported to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 hits and statistics 2 invisible mistreatments and a legal system that fails to entertain any Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports which, however, do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads were filed for domestic violence with the District Attorney General. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace courses. 86% of women's ads appeared here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically abused; 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually reported. "on every woman who reports in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so come.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of 2014, two women who do not do so" "" "" "" "will return to any woman who does not do so because of physical abuse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder is not an offence in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she had to leave. this was to regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of maltreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I always thought that only women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on maltreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she didn't leave Carlos for so long and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment had at least some complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner mistreated her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "" "" "Victoria is a member of the network" "" "" "" "I believe you" "" "" "" "made up of women who are all victims of mistreatment in any way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take seriously the statements of women.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case, everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She conducted a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# fürst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement (# Non-Few) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft law stipulates that Femizid should declare and punish a stubborn criminal act as it is already the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the wording of the law was changed in some points, in order to also win the MPs for the law who feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions would be banned, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill intended to impose a large part of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence currently have to bear, if they simply want to reimburse adverts and receive a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, maltreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethink must take place, so that violence can no longer be regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who is silent in the face of these facts, is complicit and contributes to the offender being punished.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to reimburse such a long indication that maltreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been altered. among other things, a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes are coming apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The Reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is considered a great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Israeli authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn for their reporting of corruption in the sultanate.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he is serving a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after having dismissed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, he has held the most important offices in the country: prime minister, Minister of Defence, Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic secrecy, civil liberties, including freedom of the press, to limit and to torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens, even activists, to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on Azamn newspaper, its closing and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper that has been reported since its establishment in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces arrested Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, after an article titled "High-ranking parties tie the hands of the judiciary" on 26 July 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the Editorial Board, was summoned from the Special Department and arrested on arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the Deputy Editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj, who had acted as editor-in-chief after al-Maamaran's arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that "the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any road, including online, was banned from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place before the court in Maskat.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of violations of the public order, abuse of the Internet, and "undermining of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of a violation of a ban on the public and the slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines of 3,000 omanic rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was found guilty of a year imprisonment and a fine of £1,000 ($2600) after he was found guilty of using "an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a security deposit of 5000 omanic rial (13,000 US dollars) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the release of the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Haj in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to a year and al-Maamari to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he served his prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also revoked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to allow Azamn to resume, the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the Korean government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the minister of information issued an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of information personally signed a further statement, in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and with which the minister once again objected to the decision of the Court of Appeal to permit publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom in Oman has recently been violated.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other injuries include, for example, the closure of the site of the independent journal Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the detainee of the journalist Al-Haj the impression arises that the omanic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the Korean authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. to release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that its journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. under all circumstances, human rights defenders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work unimpeded and without fear of retaliatory measures, including judicial harassment.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with its agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or is not mentioned at all. it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) at the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia.</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the Sámi national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently launching a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain a recipient rather than being a mate.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age classes.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space research, healthcare (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system means that magazines only make articles available for payment (the so-called "paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports solutions to environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 types, such as OutredGorgeous, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Mortons's work was limited by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents gaged not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants, such as grain and cartons. plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security in the future of food production due to this trend.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding salad, but now it takes longer, since his work becomes more and more difficult due to the increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is like a boulder lying in a river to whom I have to herd." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the courts no one can breed a new variety of lettuce, because all the characteristics are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours to use no material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station have bred and eaten red pipe lettuce of the Outstanding Outshouse variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement comes from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) can be inspired by the free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders are allowed to agree that others can freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately spit out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Somber prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the retired professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg points out that the "open-source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and participates in the ever-increasing mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples are the amalgamations of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available free of charge, as opposed to patent seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found that about a third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which means that it can be used either not or only difficult for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet available, but experts such as Luby suggests that large-scale crops such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those, through which their taste or colour improves up to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the altered conditions due to climate change are much less predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto spokesperson, Carly Scaduto, acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the view that intellectual property put in place other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "" "" "thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by making more material and know-how available to the public." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to stay: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we want farmers to make their job easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features: "we don't really create the features myself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are required for their cultivation of mass herbicides, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "" "" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) owns patents, it is the majority of smaller seed companies to survive without patents either - either they reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that farmers would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for themselves in a few years, "he says." with a patent it is protected 20 years before competition, which makes it very easy to put it in my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, introduces an "open-source" seed programme. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "" "" "it also supports them to come to" "" "" "" "Open Source" "" "" "" "seeds and sell their own." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agreeml is working on an open-source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(provisions for breeders differ from country to country, which is why the Ossi commitment cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, they oppose the current practice of the European Patent Office, which patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for open source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for "open source" seed systems for which the official start shot should be expected next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report. it represents the view that farmers must have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange it and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained loyal to its goal, despite this attack and the mocking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the freedom of opinion and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of site barriers to victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columnists and articles he writes for websites and media not available for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to circumvent the censor apparatus of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which also Ziada's blog is given a home, on the other hand is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting on the student protests and recording a video on how police practised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the lock-up by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to block is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blogs of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, attempted murder, summons from the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, however, after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities locked up 133 pages from 24th May to 06th of August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etiletat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In addition, afte documented the blocking of providers possible through the implementation of Internet censorship and private surf, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how to block websites offering VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering contents that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed to court against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army at a deployment in the favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the governmental crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers report in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old has shot in school," "Every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves robbed pharmacist with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air afee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting of violence in Rio, the newspaper "Extra" published the editorial "Das is not normal" in which she announced a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper like this:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what is happening in Rio will be published in the "War in Rio" section. (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a 4-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't know the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police who only shoots and then asks questions to cover up.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira has argued that violence is a "war."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning, as shown in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacency of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">According to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro described as "the most violent place in Brazil," says Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "" "" "if we look at the murders per state, Rio is ranked 16," "" "" "" "she writes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">The Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, was also one of these security policy measures, with the aim of capturing a favela by deploying a massive police custody and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning this actually led to a decline in violent death cases. for some years, however, the UPP was increasingly under attack after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux benefited from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," with which a civilian is an unobtrusive point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio will continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now time for the police to catch up the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation (PAX) and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly badly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many regional capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of the forest of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government called out a national highway out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires have also been registered in Galicia in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks covering the northern and central regions of the country, reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon area.</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire prevention measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to reduce the scale of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Bund der farmers of Portugal stated the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June, as the roads were closed very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objectionable by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which permitted the construction activity of case if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open back door, so that everything could be built," João Sorval passes on in the same article of the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily flammable wood, spread like in a vicious circle, according to the fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems include the website of the Civil Defence website of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when residents sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the fire brigade work and was so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the fall of 1994, the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various mujahedin groups defeated by the short-lived pro-Soviet government, and Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at this time, Ashark Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan, sat together for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say so, she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe never again.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn the boy was to burst open.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the smugglers.</seg>

<seg id="2883">CC-2.0</seg>
<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban, and many Hazara felt vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. work was difficult and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Ashark remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we suspended nylon in front of the open windows, so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf had left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Ashark was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high twin quotas, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions applying asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "" "" "special reception centres." "" "" "" "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to an admission centre if they officially granted a request for asylum - which can be extended for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either reliant on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so it happened.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbounded lifestyles helped Ashark to get rid of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashark Baratis "success story is now the theme of the documentary" Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy "(German:" behind Venetian luxuries - a Hazara in Italy ") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the Afghans have been created, including tailor shops, travel agents, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea for his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and kitchen staff mostly are refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome also are Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashark's goals extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail, and aim to return to the country he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are opportunities," "" "" "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "" "" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Ashark also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packing and conservation techniques. "this way they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashark made this trip herself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Citizen Report: Egypt's draft bill on social networking Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, has been in jail for more than 900 days.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo of @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot showing challenges, wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that foresees users to use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register in order to use social networks within six months of submitting a bill of law on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who neglect this step may be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or a penalty of penalties.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by sixty members of the parliament, is currently presided over by the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another MP submitted a legislative proposal to introduce stricter penalties for insulting the President or a senior official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, however, such a crime would be punishable by prison and fines, according to legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took pictures of violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the release of elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">As more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident, Shawkan had four years in prison for a court date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently his trial was postponed to the 20th May, because the prison administration failed, according to human rights groups, to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan faces death penalty as a result of one, so many human rights groups agree that exposure to weapons of arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza released the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-Morsi seat block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested during the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogate Tunisian activists to peer-reviewed documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who co-founded the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, endorses a controversial draft bill that would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, if they return all unlawfully preserved funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document, published on April 21, on the website of Nawaat, sheds light on how the Presidential plans look to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia declined the naming of his sources, stating article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which journalists granted the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their IDs?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In addition, it is stated in the rules that the registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved. it is still unclear how authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively, in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do you see us in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat transpired to register with the state government as an "organizer of the distribution of information."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government is carrying out a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make written services for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoclassniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees locking Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the locking Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications said that the site was blocked because it became "a source of information that collaborates with groups to instigate a political barrier campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is thus, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week's backed documents, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install a backdoor, decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government consulted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation is still ongoing until May 19th. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
