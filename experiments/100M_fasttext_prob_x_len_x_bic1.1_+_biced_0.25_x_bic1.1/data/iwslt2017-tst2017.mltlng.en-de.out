this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because as a New York Times journalist he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before anyone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA gave Iran a literally blu@@ ep@@ rint for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter altogether ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years the government has determined against Ris@@ en and called upon him to name its alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to judge whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the First constitutional review , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government le@@ aped upon ris@@ ings , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en had the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
all of a sudden , although they were given years of indication that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped on risks .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , re@@ porters and sources can hide more and less .
instead of separating and taking risks , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly obtained his telephone evidence ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit collection , and even travel accounts with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack @-@ alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers at his arrival , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more convic@@ ted than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional sentence , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they get in contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today , there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet celeb@@ r@@ ity , the former Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any standard contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot collect more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing ever @-@ changing es@@ pion@@ age technologies that threaten us all .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology designers such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to commit mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
or the next environmental colleague who aler@@ ts alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street Insider that warns us about the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose their crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; huge sums of money hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents of the resident law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister res@@ igned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is alleged that a trace of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting for the next release , and on the next unveiled documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems crying out from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is that if the wealthy and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that applies to all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world media and leading politicians , as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few will be used to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter .
probably because there were no prominent Americans in these dis@@ closures until now , this sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans that hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have ties to the USA .
in fact , in some U.S. countries , less information is needed , less information needs to be specified in order to establish a company than to obtain a library card .
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked that everyone to a lawyer made proposals on how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers approached us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to deal with this , we must change the rules of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that a lot has started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years , we have seen suggestions for more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been in central registers at the national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA la@@ gs behind .
representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind mock companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use legislation to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally finish the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story , as I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard selling .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a place to sleep ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; See how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , star@@ ing at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ?
a stranger is sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aking at tens of toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
maybe the people who were sold as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate attracts and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear in fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
through the Internet , they can invite wild strangers to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to fire .
but they do not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we have all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , among people who never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we were striving for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat neighbour .
this quiet touch of panic that you are feeling now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you announce on Twitter that he Can@@ did@@ ates for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to share with you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told him wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you have 150 app@@ rais@@ als that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile ?
because a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to submit negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests submitted their assessments before making them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through app@@ rais@@ als .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stems from common ground .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
we also learned that trust is dependent on how much you fare .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you get no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if one tells too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted .
so there is an optimum degree of openness , e.g. &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I am going on holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a demand that had not been met before .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who illeg@@ ally celebrated parties or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front , when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for men trust each other to justice .
if trust works , miracles can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers who tend to have a heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one properly .
you drive in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they &apos;re bringing books past .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only recommend it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , of course , not every stay is done .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing work together with money transactions ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people open a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , this is comparable to Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic for it .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you have visited , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch to share ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would embrace the idea of sharing one &apos;s share ?
I imagine cities that make society and relationships possible , rather than sol@@ itude and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces included in the government ,
students who were looking for a place to stay were offered .
were taught to people whose children were und@@ ressed ; In@@ cub@@ ator programs were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a strangers or even host today .
so the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was there before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us to overcome deep rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big impact , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I &apos;ll tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , and in relation to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you fully , and yet loves you somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned out to be ou@@ trage .
why should I do this ?
I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; Middle Eastern descent ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bomb Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country that has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect .
the same day we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as I kept silent -- as deeply as I walked in my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islam@@ ist organizations , which said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; S@@ low not you . &quot;
I stayed inside all week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day that Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims , dra@@ gged into the open and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have ev@@ oked the anger of the people to terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when will we go ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ aid and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que makes it possible for people to view other beliefs more tolerant and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
in the process of ra@@ dic@@ alization , it has been found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts are bra@@ in@@ washed , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop people going to the mos@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS justi@@ fies its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would app@@ raise ourselves to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology to be rooted in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sacred Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would have joined the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that makes sense to their fur@@ y , it was a prime goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised it a solution .
this Ima@@ m made the connection with God and her church again .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive ways of making real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her going to join the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- shows : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , conformity , and prejudi@@ ces .
a study shows that if people submit news in which they have been reported negative about Muslims , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two bal@@ lot periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
in the assignment of collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did so in her apartment , as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he fired eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about which America we want to give to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the chair we ro@@ de sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , pulled off my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me pause .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled groups were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us but to assist us .
at this moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be on the safe side ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker working in a clas@@ sy think tank , which is an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest study conducted among Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when humans appear as an exception to rule , then the rule has often been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion @-@ dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutes worldwide .
before air package delivery to our social consciousness penet@@ rated , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience .
by joining together , air devices gain high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build autonom@@ ously load@@ able structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally respond to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively , where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our labs .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine location in space , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available at the highest level . for example , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail@@ starter ,
an aircraft that attempts to hit two flies with one flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and therefore has great advantages for starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that perme@@ ate the core of the matter .
one such question would be , for example : what is the smallest number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts , gathering together to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
we recently discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ controlled aircraft . it was invented lately .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse rows , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , there is so much happening inside the interior so that it can fly smoothly and move everywhere in the room .
but it doesn &apos;t have the sle@@ ek algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to make it fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right when I see all is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in in@@ toxic@@ ation , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abo@@ und ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in doing so , he receives the necessary liter@@ al ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it rot@@ ates or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive flows from the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned right when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
if aircraft are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when assembling them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller dies off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue flying , albeit limited .
we will now demonstrate this by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the very safe machine over there wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us , the wage lies in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
some 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , so they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
for this short moment they bri@@ gh@@ tened bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not release them in the form of light --
finally we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then , the earth has produced quite a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which form through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized her as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Interfer@@ ometer @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ Observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of lig@@ o increased significantly , which improved the recognition performance enormously .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ amed through the earth through the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my sick father .
basically , these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories like lig@@ o measurable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when the shaft is pulled over , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ ew@@ ed into the other .
for illustration , lectures on rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a really sil@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and spra@@ ying . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each one of us was stretched and st@@ owed by us at the arrival of the waves . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . so one explained the Lig@@ o @-@ employee for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic essay about gra@@ vit@@ ation
description Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you .
it is different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mm@@ y Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot create simple images of objects in space with them .
but by watching changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the universe literally .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , cir@@ cling simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . this sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; surf noise &#93; No one who knows what to listen to recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the sticks of your sha@@ ker .
AA : let &apos;s talk about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way of exploring the universe , as it never was possible before .
on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space , we can -- practically or fundamentally -- do not see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes occur in the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through as this op@@ ak is .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by its own after@@ glow .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there are all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , in the first run , Lig@@ o found things we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the sour bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build magnificent metal detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
let us dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say yes .
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , eliminated my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an un@@ expectedly kind . it began with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; for un@@ expla@@ in@@ able reasons ,
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my car@@ ving cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she asked her once , if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on I sw@@ am to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I do or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , aw@@ aken you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce TV .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
$ 350 million for a season .
in America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the bon@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else does it ?
no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I talk about work so you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it &apos;s right when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming with a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as if I set up troops , as if I painted on a screen .
this is how to make a high sound , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a h@@ um starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could drive for ever on her .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s what it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I started to work and work , create , create and collaborate with TV production , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the tot@@ em is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the tot@@ em is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a tot@@ em , then you can not strive differently than by size .
the feeling of not being different than striving for size doesn &apos;t matter what price .
this is called tot@@ em .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I &apos;m not a failure , and I know only that I love bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more crowded borders , the more work there are , the more things the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sum . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single stit@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ mon@@ ed ceased .
the hum@@ ming of the engine st@@ alled .
I did not love my work any more . the engine was out of hand .
the tot@@ em did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase Titan ,
everything was grey , I simply had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the sw@@ um I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; present yourself stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re working , you love what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , being a mother , a painter , Bill G@@ ates , you just love another , and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the tot@@ em when you stop the hum@@ ming , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m a Titan and ro@@ b my hum@@ ming , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of thumb , I can do nothing except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no secret . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the h@@ um , the h@@ um , the titanium h@@ um , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself by using shows and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real h@@ um is .
the h@@ um is not a force and it is not work specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real hum@@ ming is dependent on love .
the tot@@ em is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real hum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure .
the real hum@@ ming is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this to a fixed rule , so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not at all available to me as to how they work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work rather than to be home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we are r@@ ushing around in the garden , back and forth , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it &apos;s ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever ceased playing games ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit is replacing me .
and when my daughter is talking to me for 15 minutes , I am mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even in a bad mood !
15 minutes in a row !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are getting ready .
but 15 minutes are possible !
my children are my welfare state , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ em , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s all about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what &apos;s good for you .
find out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I divide and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short of everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes on the track , why not indulge in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not the sum , the tot@@ als are not me ... no more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
that is my hum@@ ming now .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s up to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire still burns .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country that I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , bare and new feeling of life spreads within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think of things , I aw@@ aken you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ti@@ ters don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions by different surgical techniques .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known ones , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; an electro@@ de is im@@ planted deep in the brain in order to influence the neur@@ ons circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that in Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mata the brain is s@@ wollen and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save lives , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to make them thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to win .
he saw that under his microscope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they slowly shared their lives and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ Con@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain bark cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why stay they ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear , however , -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean @-@ François did .
and they subsequently highlight color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ planted them at the reception centre of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ implant@@ ing these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ implant the same cells in a damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Professor Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we applied the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we had an injury to and re @-@ implant@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ ported .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we color in vitro , in culture .
of course , we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain damage ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets of a tablet .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor motor area in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just as with the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before the injury .
it is not as precise and not as fast .
see now , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the her@@ m@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate her in man .
I really hope to show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely do .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these types of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes for someone to come to the hospital and that treatment will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is actually , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as in@@ variable ge@@ aring .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economical model for a real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group succ@@ um@@ b to mis@@ belief , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are becoming bri@@ ghter , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that th@@ rows its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the high net worth of savers and corporations , which , however , are too timi@@ d to invest there where it would be productive and generate income with which we could carry off the debt hill and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the US , England and the euro@@ zone , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until we compare it to the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollars which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate stock exchanges and to raise real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks which are not equ@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , in fear , the prophes@@ y of the op@@ per , could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow up ,
un@@ intentionally causing the circumstances causing O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my sh@@ edding with capitalism --
his extravag@@ ant art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the Earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
of course the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it advoc@@ ated the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , that they granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in questions of state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burnt out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a by@@ word for rulers .
for the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations - became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place by gradually sub@@ trac@@ ting the economy and deprived them of it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not related to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays you can be in the government and still not in power , because the power has sli@@ pped away from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has chann@@ eled politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , inequality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash in their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , like it -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we must re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economics and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re @-@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentary .
the question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something similar to the &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; society in which people are serving their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the matrix @-@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no more distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there whom the company does not belong to . no more money between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of the whole of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which they preferred privileged people , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage dump of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in our hands and we do better democr@@ atically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am completely confused .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , don &apos;t think of enough .
BG : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you spoke very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- Do you remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to acc@@ use China now , to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greece &apos;s finance ministers at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you return to the first half @-@ year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal perspective , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing as we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to us and the ongoing denial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to massi@@ vely threaten the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which inci@@ dentally , was the first suggestion that revealed this denial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European group , have continued to choose denial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when change happens , it will happen ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BA : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the part of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring our government case , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro zone .
they did not want to conc@@ ede that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika , who imposed this policy , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is faced by someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
from Roy Price , most have never heard before , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision Roy had met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon &apos;s TV production company .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel hair@@ do and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought sector .
there are so many TV shows that Roy does not choose any .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows on the right of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review .
if your show is valued at nine and above , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at that end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think one needs special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he gets more thoughts about the mean bul@@ let , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is there , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can look at everyone for free .
and if Amazon gives out things for free , do you use it right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , what parts you jump over or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this reads : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
for instance at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design by Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this one super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team have watched the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the pieces together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four trans@@ formers , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , House of Cards . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this corner . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says somehow that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimised by very powerful computers .
the minimum you can expect is good TV , right ?
if data analysis does not work , it is a bit frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time where we gather more and more into statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . if you come into contact , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not they are fired .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it could predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , by data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature .
it worked fine , year around year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the journal Nature .
even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data stream into decisions of life - at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics - an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as deciding on cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you ever have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first of all de@@ compose this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a branch , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to be put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do otherwise . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they embark@@ ed on a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did so in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is what the data tells us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just one tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will put it out later on with a technical demonstration .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have been listening to the ball in hind@@ sight .
but , as you obviously know , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
