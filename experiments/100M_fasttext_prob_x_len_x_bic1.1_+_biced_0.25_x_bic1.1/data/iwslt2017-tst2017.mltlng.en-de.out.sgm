<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because as a New York Times journalist he won the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA gave Iran a literally blueprint for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter altogether?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to name its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to judge whistleblower and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "according to the First constitutional review, the media have the right to publish secret information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government leaped upon risings, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen had the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of a sudden, although they were given years of indication that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped on risks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separating and taking risks, they could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly obtained his telephone evidence,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit collection, and even travel accounts with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack-alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers at his arrival, but instead, the judiciary has more convicted than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional sentence, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they get in contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there is communication software that didn't exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet celebrity, the former Aaron Swartz, and is today being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any standard contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot collect more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing ever-changing espionage technologies that threaten us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology designers such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to commit misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental colleague who alerts alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street Insider that warns us about the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose their crimes but to protect our constitutional rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [huge sums of money hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents of the resident law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trace of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting for the next release, and on the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying out from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is that if the wealthy and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that applies to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world media and leading politicians, as secret tax havens of some few will be used to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans in these disclosures until now, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans that hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have ties to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some U.S. countries, less information is needed, less information needs to be specified in order to establish a company than to obtain a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we really shocked that everyone to a lawyer made proposals on how to transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers approached us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about how the system works, through corruption, evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and to deal with this, we must change the rules of the game." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite well that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the past few years, we have seen suggestions for more transparency concerning the owners of companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been in central registers at the national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA lags behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind mock companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use legislation to end this kind of intransparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "together we can finally finish the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard selling.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "" "" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "" "" "I don't know." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "" "" "and I thought," "" "" "" "Oh, man!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a place to sleep?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "then I heard myself saying," "" "" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "" "" "a voice in my head said," "" "" "" "See how please?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "" "" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneaking at tens of toes to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate attracts and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Through the Internet, they can invite wild strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to fire.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we have all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on the things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, among people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic that you are feeling now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he Candidates for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to share with you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name; if he had told him whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 appraisals that all say: "he can really capture very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to submit negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests submitted their assessments before making them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add a person's call -- in our case through appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that trust is dependent on how much you fare.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "if you tell too little, like" "" "" "" "Hi!" "" "" "", "you get no answer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">If one tells too much, as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is rather not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimum degree of openness, e.g. "great works of art in your apartment! I am going on holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a demand that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who illegally celebrated parties or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust each other to justice.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, miracles can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to have a heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save lives, even though they don't know one properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they're bringing books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">"" "" "" "I can only recommend it!" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay is done.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "" "" "but to call it just" "" "" "" "rental industry" "" "" "", "the thing is not fair." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, this is comparable to Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic for it.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you have visited, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch to share?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would embrace the idea of sharing one's share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that make society and relationships possible, rather than solitude and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces included in the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Students who were looking for a place to stay were offered.</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were undressed; Incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a strangers or even host today.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I'll tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A wannabe-fitness-fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen me.</seg>

<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, doubted, and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confident and slow devotion, which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, understands you fully, and yet loves you somehow?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "" "" "I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked up on the screen and saw the word" "" "" "" "breaking news" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned out to be outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do this?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the TV channel and heard: "... Muslim terrorists..." "... in the name of Islam..." "Middle Eastern descent..."... "Jihad..."... "bomb Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country that has been attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I kept silent -- as deeply as I walked in my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamist organizations, which said: "be alert," "Be careful," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Slow not you."</seg>

<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-aid and Olympic athletes.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque makes it possible for people to view other beliefs more tolerant and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalization, it has been found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family so that the extremists are brainwashed, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people going to the mosque." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would appraise ourselves to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would have joined the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergyman with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that makes sense to their fury, it was a prime goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised it a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the connection with God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive ways of making real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her going to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- shows: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity, and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if people submit news in which they have been reported negative about Muslims, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood swings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two ballot periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective guilt, it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when was such an accomplished young man from my brother?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her as well as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon. he did so in her apartment, as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired eight times in Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about which America we want to give to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the chair we rode silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled off my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me pause.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled groups were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be on the safe side?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker working in a classy think tank, which is an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at Muslims all over the world, and I did this with the largest study conducted among Muslims all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When humans appear as an exception to rule, then the rule has often been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion-dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutes worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package delivery to our social consciousness penetrated, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience.</seg>
<seg id="410">By joining together, air devices gain high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build autonomously loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulences and generally respond to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must know collectively, where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our labs.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine location in space, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available at the highest level. for example, "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tailstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that attempts to hit two flies with one flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can float, and therefore has great advantages for starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions that permeate the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example: what is the smallest number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts, gathering together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We recently discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled aircraft. it was invented lately.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rows, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, there is so much happening inside the interior so that it can fly smoothly and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">But it doesn't have the sleek algorithm of the rear-starters. to make it fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right when I see all is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in intoxication, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abound?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In doing so, he receives the necessary literal ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it rotates or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive flows from the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned right when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If aircraft are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When assembling them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller dies off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue flying, albeit limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The very safe machine over there wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us, the wage lies in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">Some 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, so they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they brightened brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not release them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which form through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized her as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the Laser-Interferometer-gravitational-waves-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of ligo increased significantly, which improved the recognition performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to solve some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves roamed through the earth through the two colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their through observatories like ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational-wave is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When the shaft is pulled over, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stewed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lectures on relativity theory often lead to a really silly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and spraying."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each one of us was stretched and stowed by us at the arrival of the waves. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. so one explained the Ligo-employee for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic essay about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Description Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummy Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot create simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by watching changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been working very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circling simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. this sounds like the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [surf noise] No one who knows what to listen to recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the sticks of your shaker.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's talk about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way of exploring the universe, as it never was possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can -- practically or fundamentally -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes occur in the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as this opak is.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first few minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is obscured by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, in the first run, Ligo found things we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sour bones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us a completely different view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build magnificent metal detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Let us dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "" "" "for one year I would say" "" "" "" "Yes!" "" "" "", "which I feared." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say yes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social fear -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes" "" "" "" "changed my life</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpectedly kind. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all "kittens" for unexplainable reasons,</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "kitten, I need milk for my carving cup." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "" "" "she asked her once, if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "" "" "Yes" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on I swam to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I do or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes simultaneously in production four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the bonfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I talk about work so you understand that I'm not just walking around the computer and fanciful, and it's right when I say: I understand that it's not about dreaming with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as if I painted on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">This is how to make a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A hum starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could drive for ever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that's what it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I started to work and work, create, create and collaborate with TV production, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totem is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The totem is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a totem, then you can not strive differently than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for size doesn't matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called totem.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I'm not a failure, and I know only that I love buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more crowded borders, the more work there are, the more things the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, overdone, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mum is a single stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "" "" "Harper tells people:" "" "" "" "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "" "" "and Emerson says:" "" "" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the summoned ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine stalled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work any more. the engine was out of hand.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totem did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I simply had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the swum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "" "" "I know some may think:" "" "" "" "present yourself stupid author-Titan." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you're doing, you're working, you love what you're doing, being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another, and that gives you the buzz when you know the totem when you stop the humming, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "I'm on the way out late and she says:" "" "" "" "mum, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "" "" "she doesn't call anyone more" "" "" "" "kitten" "" "" "". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm a Titan and rob my humming, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "" "" "and so she says:" "" "" "" "Mama, do you like playing?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "" "" "and I say:" "" "" "" "yes" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and lack of thumb, I can do nothing except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No secret. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The hum, the hum, the titanium hum, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself by using shows and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real hum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The hum is not a force and it is not work specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totem is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real humming ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real humming is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this to a fixed rule, so that I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not at all available to me as to how they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person prefers to work rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan."</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are rushing around in the garden, back and forth, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it's ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever ceased playing games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a ladybug or biscuit is replacing me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And when my daughter is talking to me for 15 minutes, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, there is no need for more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even in a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes in a row!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are getting ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my welfare state, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the totem, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's all about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "" "" "to" "" "" "" "play" "" "" "" "in general</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what's good for you.</seg>

<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I divide and I won. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short of everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track, why not indulge in 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzzing then seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the humming, but I don't love it.</seg>

<seg id="777">The sum of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>

<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country that I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the other, the right buzz: the buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, consistent, bare and new feeling of life spreads within me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to deal with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions by different surgical techniques.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most well-known ones, the "deep brain stimulation." an electrode is implanted deep in the brain in order to influence the neurons circuits in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in Schädel-Hirn-Traumata the brain is swollen and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save lives, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to make them thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed to win.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked just like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly shared their lives and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called DoubleContin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain bark cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently highlight color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-planted them at the reception centre of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-implanting these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Professor Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we applied the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury to and re-implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we color in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course, we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain damage?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets of a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor motor area in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just as with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now, when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the hermplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate her in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope to show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely do.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these types of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes for someone to come to the hospital and that treatment will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is actually, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as invariable gearing.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clear to me as the finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economical model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup succumb to misbelief, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are becoming brighter, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "" "" "I call it the" "" "" "" "twin peaks paradox." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that throws its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to the high net worth of savers and corporations, which, however, are too timid to invest there where it would be productive and generate income with which we could carry off the debt hill and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the US, England and the eurozone, 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">Trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until we compare it to the 5.1 trillion US Dollars which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except to inflate stock exchanges and to raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks which are not equated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, as in a continuous loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, who, in fear, the prophesy of the opper, could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causing the circumstances causing Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my shedding with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extravagant art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course the Athenian democracy closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Athenian democracy on account of these exclusion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it advocated the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, that they granted them the right to political co-determination with equal voting in questions of state concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is also quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, today's liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a byword for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations - became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place by gradually subtracting the economy and deprived them of it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not related to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays you can be in the government and still not in power, because the power has slipped away from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, that they end up starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has channeled politics so far that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash in their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, like it -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economics and politics, and make sure that we democratize the re-united area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that makes the film "matrix" like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that of "Matrix," or something similar to the "Star Trek" society in which people are serving their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia rather than the matrix-like dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No more distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there whom the company does not belong to. no more money between capital and labour, no gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of the whole of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which they preferred privileged people, and Marxist, because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage dump of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is in our hands and we do better democratically." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, don't think of enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you spoke very clearly what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I can say this provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- Do you remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To accuse China now, to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>

<seg id="1038">From Roy Price, most have never heard before, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision Roy had met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon's TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igel hairdo and describes himself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy does not choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows on the right of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a season, your brain asks: "where are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think one needs special intelligence to prohibit "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He gets more thoughts about the mean bullet, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is there, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can look at everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out things for free, do you use it right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you pause, what parts you jump over or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and this reads: "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on.</seg>
<seg id="1073">For instance at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design by Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this one super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team have watched the available data about the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give to the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the pieces together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four transformers, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, House of Cards. Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this corner. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you have two very competitive, data-sealed companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimised by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum you can expect is good TV, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, it is a bit frightening, because we live in a time where we gather more and more into statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. if you come into contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not they are fired.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it could predict outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, by data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data stream into decisions of life - at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics - an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as deciding on cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First of all decompose this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a branch, you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to be put together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they embarked on a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did so in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "" "" "it was a safe decision because they could always say," "" "" "" "This is what the data tells us." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just one tool, and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will put it out later on with a technical demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have been listening to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you obviously know, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball will be smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
