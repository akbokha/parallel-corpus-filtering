Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ institution , where young people should meet today .
a pit chapel , which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the former cause of farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not up to date .
everybody knows this , because the car navigation device showed a green lawn instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but that is why it is very revealing .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
in the large map of the map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called initial sheets , were incorporated for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian distribution management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria on behalf of , of course , for military purposes .
even though the French troops were finally dra@@ fted with the Peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card .
Elec@@ tor Max IV moved the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and there@@ with the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration .
the information sheet for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of former / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was established 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ sus &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
there are no farmers in small plots there , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in the Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the sheet of documents , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
there was the Munich Kreis @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; on the Au@@ er Venti@@ tet &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 .
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , finished the cigar@@ ettes of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients had been pla@@ gu@@ ed , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity did not suff@@ ice any more - the reason for the construction of the circle division in hair in 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there since 2006 .
on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet at Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East lies west , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural style based on the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing ra@@ ids .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered as &quot; Main Square &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the shopping street was called the &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bombs ra@@ ged many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
one big remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days are the prepar@@ atory work and on April 5 , 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn regular track takes place .
with the sli@@ der , you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes Travel forecast for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the national union for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , scheduled to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for special attention to African @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , as a number of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based incidents occur throughout the country and are noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently passed Bill of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , led the group to issue the warning message , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights , people pass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints about such a frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in du@@ bi@@ ous circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the voyage through the state and was put into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s office in Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is shown to be 75 percent more common in the state than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring a deposit or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI investigation programme , which classi@@ fies the state regarding the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view of further race profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have acted as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
grass@@ roots project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ men Wei@@ de@@ mage project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ man CD@@ U @-@ village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the Pi@@ v@@ ot Gra@@ ve@@ yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insight into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young as well as accommod@@ ates in five apartments holiday palaces .
for him , the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , according to Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este there is exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the chairman of the B@@ L@@ H@@ V chair@@ person , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary important &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot produce profit@@ ably on such steep areas .
the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much needs to be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not conduct bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the significance of the grass@@ roots project and is glad about the leadership development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is those who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants .
the area of disclosure is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of them were promoted by leaders , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ man .
consequently , the farmers had to spend 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of pasture @-@ fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter White also stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Care Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg will enable the state support of the f@@ ences .
the aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the area must not be tractor @-@ resistant ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence of just 16 kilometres , is currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ ts@@ 2018 .
the surface area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the President for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty cre@@ ators would have heard him if he had done it .
but he resor@@ ted to their importance , and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is really correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites an old immig@@ rant , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the miserable fall of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Tru@@ mp USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of liberty in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo@@ conservative who brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it shall carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ fic journeys on the decks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but infl@@ ame the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black gra@@ bs Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the British team .
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think there is something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ier - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m stretch while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team as team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally included were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in her fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it &apos;s &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir takes this path and last year set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman for watching after a great season , which included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots , which belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : do not enter@@ tain you for a public office if you cannot tolerate the citizens of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .
he smil@@ ed at the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land , Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this very beginning of this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the action as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat@@ sink .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skil@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his constitu@@ ents and play his hair @-@ less head for chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum designated as official and paid for by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ professional .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled with water but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call another &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times , if one had done the same that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators .
but this is exactly what happens digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise that he has insul@@ ted Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones on this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ated First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
that shouldn &apos;t be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck him on his lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zing his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ sent and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and real leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in Renaissance Club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led the Ar@@ cher@@ field Left to the final round before losing against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending champi@@ ons for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the promotion on home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancers caused by passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists at the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( U@@ KE ) are participating in this study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking in 16@@ 7 , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison he drew up his own study on this subject of 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to pas@@ siv@@ ity in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said the manager of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as much se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which again and again im@@ pe@@ des construction work , is a major problem for the building division of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and lock@@ outs is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular bus lines are authorized to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and Death in the Indon@@ esian Gold Land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the un@@ quiet Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ med tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless shelter serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous late to work : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders should vote by a public raise in front of the occupying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal experts .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that encomp@@ assed the eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
the city , with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and of corrugated iron roofs , which were converted into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing this garment , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light coat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had only leaves on our bodies in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has reduced its value of US $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Papua has estimated US $ 78 billion worth of wood resources .
but these riches are a source of misery for the Papua people to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port &apos;s local military units and units paid almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 crimes have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military .
the kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s were genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
it is said in a report by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese from 2016 in which reports on the atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal execution and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims , since incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have strengthened , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai unit , who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native Papua ( M@@ um ) mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua has cost their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of the rights in Papua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we tuned for Jok@@ ow@@ i 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ov &apos;s inaugur@@ ation , Pan@@ i@@ ai had a low point in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted , and beat the group with their ri@@ fle @-@ guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was severely beaten to fall into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was ign@@ ited and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young people , women and children gathered at a football ground in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the qu@@ ita dance - running around in a circle and im@@ itating a song of birds - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said it in an official document of TI@@ ME that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his bri@@ ghtly painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ami still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news of the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he has set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; which claimed over 1,000 lives in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody declaration of independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims rebu@@ ked those claims with severe un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in the neighbourhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious husband to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers to be held accoun@@ table and to withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ gade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trouble shooting for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Freie Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty allevi@@ ates dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : mainly not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native countries of Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region generally go to the better educated and prosp@@ erous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua people rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own enterprises .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world off from Papua .
in addition , restrictions in reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ da and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua , due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov &apos;s electoral campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report to Indonesia &apos;s uns@@ ett@@ led eastern provinces of Papua and West Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the Indon@@ esian Foreign Ministry spokes@@ man Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and told journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local people want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4th May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say they probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai committees , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council .
he wants Jok@@ ov to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is found in poor educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; blame , &quot; which he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims made a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fires record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per of Dubai for the second time
a fire found its way through Dubai on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ floor building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is often called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who named his name as George , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing fire at 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damages occurred from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said that the system of panels for insulation and facing on the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) went through his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho @-@ Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two sets of profits for this sport was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but precisely because of that very much appreciated five @-@ set classic remain the traditional value .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for the reform , and the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was scarcely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our Member States did not accept the whole package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical events , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will continue to work on improving the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even before the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal was already in front of the proposal to carry out the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : in the future , the fin@@ alists will have the right to host the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the following year in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers carry forbidden objects to the plane , find a pol@@ l
a survey conducted among airline passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ intentionally prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled by the US Transportation Security Administration &apos;s control points , including at least 6 percent that boar@@ ded the aircraft while they accidentally carried out prohibited blades or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they were late discovering that they had mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , carried out by a Jet Charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of those surve@@ yed , who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were millenni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent admitted to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades through security control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had intentionally forbidden drugs in the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers around the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods had been brought through airport security and how many had deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - are wearing safety , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : ten thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has hitherto under@@ estimated that some of the clients have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the constantly triumph@@ ant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure in announ@@ cing the recent quarterly balance : the number of cancell@@ ations made at the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery had just begun .
now , Mus@@ k ad@@ mits that 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that this is only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1,000 and in Britain 1,000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
at present 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , in a telephone conference with analysts one .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not on demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models will be collected - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are made per day .
anyone who orders a model 3 can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new production lines that are never tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum occup@@ ancy .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there is too much delay , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s because of dela@@ ying the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , took back his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive than previous administr@@ ations to the needs of the state environmental authorities .
he did not mention the suit filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
a deadline was set for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the following year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was the prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on blocking or dela@@ ying regulations which resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ sion regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ces EPA &apos;s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards .
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often neglected the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be accused by activists and others , and in an agreement setting the deadline for carrying out , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available power &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive collection of o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York included California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont , Washington and the District of Columbia .
floor o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smoke can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about P@@ ru@@ ck &apos;s surprising exchange of course .
&quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ bling celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ bl@@ ings will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ ois a concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Register of Docum@@ ents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z &quot; sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document according to the certificate , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard , which belonged to the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age right and not the other way round .
so there were people there too .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ bl@@ ings , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the lord mayor of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied himself with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
this was accompanied by the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two fell on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed out later in the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were sm@@ ashed and the bell rings were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the church tower was left standing .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half of it collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g existing today remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
on Sunday , July 16 , the Friends and Con@@ vey@@ ors of Tum@@ lin@@ ens invite the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler University of Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing words .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
to conclude the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers provide the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tur@@ mo@@ il and deaf @-@ t@@ elec@@ on@@ ers .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ ois are particularly committed to home care , such as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to let wind turbines test approval
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal pre@@ condition for construction and therefore has turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bo@@ is@@ heim Foundation is called on by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration camp existed at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
in this concentration camp , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exploitation of wind energy for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ ess &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had approved a second wind power concentration camp in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette just a few days earlier - but this had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district government due to a form failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore withdraw , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the sum@@ mons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .

city and tra@@ der plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city council want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the inhabitants for shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city holds apart from the usual supermarket goods .
according to this plan , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their apprentices@@ hips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not just aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend are Christian king .
the Municip@@ ality and Business Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
in this way , the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all business owners and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be opened again or again .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost sight of the city centre while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , companies all over the city and clubs .
König had said in the spring that a network of le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy was able to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ illing &quot; day was part of the nation &apos;s third &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ illing &quot; day , five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za there are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mm@@ er@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting local trade and growing its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchasing behaviour can influence his / her direct environment .

Tru@@ mp reli@@ ed on blocked tran@@ scripts from phone calls Mexico under pressure due to payment of the border wall
telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tru@@ mp sum@@ mon@@ ed En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to in a telephone conversation with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to publicly that he would not pay for a planned bor@@ der@@ line .
the President of the US tigh@@ tened him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ or to make Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; l@@ ousy &quot; and &quot; sil@@ ly , &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was conveyed by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; dump@@ ing &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : milit@@ ants lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer @-@ suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looking through the wind@@ screen .
inside , the occup@@ ants were floating in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this aw@@ ful scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a reproduction .
but when a no@@ ose kno@@ cks around the neck of Roger , almost all of them hit the audience very real si@@ ghs .
since 2005 civil rights activists came back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were as@@ yn@@ ged by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really in@@ conceivable that no one person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who helps organizing the post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want to heal , we want reconciliation , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic physician places a blanket over the body of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ making process .
but no one ever was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the loose for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the ly@@ n@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer campaign .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby carrying her did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white Land@@ lord , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they came from prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and has covered the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ isely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a massacre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual im@@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is understandable , po@@ ign@@ ant and gro@@ unded in a kind of deep racism , many of whom wish to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to look at , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because then we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who cries out the high priest and urged him to get angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , he , get away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona returns the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out laughing .
gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; he asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was wit@@ ching one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship is replacing the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona said the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with sad@@ ness stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and brings Bil@@ lie Holidays ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ensive lob@@ by@@ ist &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many only come down the street .
they have spent nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children squ@@ at on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy compla@@ ins as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ hid hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have done it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later , the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
sitting at a table a white pair from Atlanta is chat@@ ting about the post @-@ position with a black pair they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words , which felt the performance of the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do it because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police sho@@ ot@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks &apos;s courtyard stops at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ delivery is in a certain way inspiring , because it describes the dre@@ ad of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colourful fri@@ vol@@ e production in front of a giant , six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows optionally a du@@ sty street corner with the Berlin Wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it is an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ pf@@ chter are pos@@ ing as a rock ergi@@ r@@ ls or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that is attracted by his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ pots - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in &quot; Das Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
in the case of Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , she moves into the trunk of the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and releases the Kra@@ fran@@ o cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully fu@@ cking Ha@@ gen surrounding the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
brutal the scene when he shu@@ ff@@ les Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are stor@@ my , who humble himself and bends his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which for the first time shows itself on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
in 2013 he had to endure a g@@ able pipe concert in 2013 , followed by a great jubil@@ ation five years later , in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were going .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner should have been happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience has not only made a form of peace with cast@@ or , but also an understanding of what they see .
I draw a positive resume .
Max . works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to go everywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture store , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with that ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years old , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
crowd : I have passed S@@ LC .
and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled .
I recognized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different , work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it really is , at the focal point , in the focal point .
and was it like that ?
crowd : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
volume : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing your FS@@ J .
one can make it from an old home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very diversified .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that attracted me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different from the degree of civil engineering ?
quantity : well , it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
one always has other people in front of the head , who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent since another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the reduction in job cuts , which was predominantly announced by General Director John Fall@@ on by the end of 2018 and early 2019 , is in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 jobs were already lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in a third cost @-@ cutting program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed at suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials say .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , divided a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement by NATO it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement says that all injured are in a stable state and be treated in the U.S. military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby district .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces forced the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp considers to increase the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul caused a crisis of public trust to the government , its policies and , in particular , to the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA inver@@ ts decision to delay the smo@@ g rule following suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has ann@@ ul@@ led a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , according to which states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states acc@@ eded the agency because of the step .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Policy 2015 , &quot; and said it will show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in some part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in order to determine where inc@@ isions must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by the end of October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the Municip@@ ality of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to drive a broad range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature protection groups that are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone can reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms , such as asthma .
community wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing votes , the community council of flu@@ orn win@@ ches decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the sales contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports the mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
while the church community is still a part of the community , there is now no obstacle for the project to be stem@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council prefer not to fores@@ ee such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ vy @-@ just living , but openly in the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , will be decided by means of funding .
the building is located in the rehabilitation area .
according to T@@ j@@ aden , the establishment of a common space would be eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed resolution is that in order to signal the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw a bil@@ l@@ board between the legs , the statement that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding building - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the height of the pitch and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer writes that this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the committee .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which one can &apos;t go forward so much , but now they lean out of the window in the common room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy of investors anyway , or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface one does not give a subsi@@ dy , but receives a real counterpart in doubt , is the counter@@ f@@ eit .
Sta@@ y &apos;s request to split the resolution accordingly finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
this is how it remains with two opposing votes in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; if we handle the decision , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision by car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
on the crossing of the road a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way from the road Schwar@@ zer Weg to Hil@@ den on the bicycle path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction allowed him to take preced@@ ence .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the traffic .
he met with a car , which was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old hel@@ per .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching car .
FC Bayern Munich do not have to miss the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with staff worries the FC Bayern moves to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven pros are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup versus the cup winner .
the staff of the German football record champion Bavaria Munich are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to do without the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
the Mün@@ ch@@ horns Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at least . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
wandering in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the plan of the association Observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaches the need for information from many visitors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it combines nature , science , movement and athletic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase until 2018 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z are planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ spec@@ torate came from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network reception is important when selecting a location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewers learn a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained .
in addition , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than any other , although it is far more distant .
in which con@@ stellation you will find a selected star and when to see when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the site in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with the naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet path .
starting at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary road leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ planet at the end point - are set exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth is thus shr@@ inking to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to requires approximately eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the beaten World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down the hall to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ ated Champion .
following Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the ex @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7@@ pm on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to lightweight fighters &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is demanding the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this struggle could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later pushed out to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko listened to Gar@@ cia with gener@@ ously praise and said that he thinks the three @-@ war champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks &quot; very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ end . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show punch strength , then boxes .
both said that they could sense the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ sts
in case of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were seriously injured in the afternoon .
following initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market shortly before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green belt .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left stri@@ pe could be passed by at the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; thir@@ d@@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 to kick off the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , Germany , that optimi@@ zes the defensive formation in Au@@ e Points .
Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the first season of the season , with the result that the two opponents were not against Br@@ uns@@ wick at 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the supply chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free fall , the For@@ tun@@ as don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew famili@@ ari@@ zes well with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain at the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann &apos;s players who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , but that we do better harmon@@ ize and we do not have so many play@@ able mistakes in building up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann too goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whether you can speak of a mis@@ leading start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I only judged the start of the season after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm .
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , believing that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascent favorite in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as chief coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age review tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of tested people are older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Ministry of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started the tests last year .
they should take a closer look at the age of asylum during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were under age .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent out 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays are made of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological ri@@ pen@@ ess of humans to see if they were usually going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proceeding well .
on Wednesday a load of seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good in time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Building and Traffic at the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a peripheral fixation , which is also used as operating path .
on Friday , a 2,@@ 20 metre wide bridge deck is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to proceed .
the special thing about this is that these are finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required laying cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected .
in the run @-@ up to the work the local residents were informed about the project .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting area in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is governed by a traffic light .
the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance .
the costs for the three bre@@ ed@@ ings amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest in German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties move on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , what else is difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG and left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle in R@@ ond@@ ell invites for a &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy Bundes@@ chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ei@@ fel is colourful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the square - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that is offered .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A world and one of the organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; ur@@ inate potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police have ordered a lot of civil servants according to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence above all at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ me reports from the Af@@ D volcanic Ei@@ fel , he tried to get such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the R@@ ond@@ ell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz square , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D leader Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy Bundes@@ chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to keep their speeches .
the police presence remained unchanged , but so far the officials had a peaceful evening .
a little more than an hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ ei@@ descend@@ ant Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov solo trump@@ eters at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both united the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
like in a new gown , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; sounds like a Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz singer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m , classical , jazz and free play combine to form a fascinating whole masterpiece .
this key piece of the program was premi@@ ered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ lach monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart was completely open about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ness .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ ess ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I had dat@@ et .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten stated that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially among them , she says &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in the school@@ days when she prefers to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be acting in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp to change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp announced a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement in which it said : &quot; the change of party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last refusal of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ced on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport .
Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he decided to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were gra@@ bbed for gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF agreed to maintain the ban imposed on November 2015 after a World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) report found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e to the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports Task Force recommendations that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athlete from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a rein@@ statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug testing is still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral ceremony for soldiers in Mali
during a funeral service in the north Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar some 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defense , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the still un@@ solved crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they described them as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their field &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died in Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral Sankt Peter .
at noon only the members of the church took their leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ners laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
the Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ anic .
the stru@@ t @-@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flight operation of the helicopter lift tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ chs , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if the crew could not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of Le@@ yen : the deployment would be dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country that we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they will be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
that divided the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Dom@@ kirche of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the queen agreed to her husband &apos;s decision , and she said it in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also sets off the title &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the principal speaker of the Danish roy@@ alty .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old is finally to be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he worked for over the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always imp@@ eded , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his 50 @-@ year @-@ old reg@@ ent@@ ship with the Dan@@ es .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ ken so@@ cks instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Parliament &apos;s resolution was pronounced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens party from its parliament in Lower Saxony has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the country elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ vote majority in parliament against the opposition of the CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 Ele@@ ction in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U leader , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend his faction to include them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the land of Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new landing day will be regularly voted on January 14 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green government should now decide whether to continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the day of the land resol@@ ves as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State Constitution also provides the possibility that the Parliament el@@ ects the Minister @-@ President to trust and elect a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be checked legally clean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will answer all questions in peace if they are legally examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called himself a black @-@ green trailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we assume , of course , that she has given immediate effect to her Land@@ tag Archives , which she has received via the green national list , &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision made by El@@ ke T@@ erns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the President of the Socialists and Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian loc@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its viol@@ ated vanity and fru@@ stration its personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony brings along this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to beat political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D vice @-@ president Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ NP in the CD@@ U .
the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 State Parliament election with personal career giving .
the CD@@ U was then the strongest force in the SPD and the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the day before the SPD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do we protect ourselves from greed , Mr Schmidt ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal last ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
the Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) and answer .
Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
infected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we currently know , health hazards are practically impossible .
Al@@ di now assumes the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture .
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the const@@ ern@@ ation of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade , as well as the manufacturers , has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and health @-@ safe .
if eggs of the residual residual contents of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg are exceeded , they are not transpor@@ table .
un@@ polluted eggs can however be sold and eaten .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , production plants do not have immediate guilt .
instead , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too few controllers in the crop .
is it missing only in the personnel or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that uncovered the process .
however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
for this reason , a consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences are available is of crucial importance .
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular alar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and bu@@ oy@@ ant foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly sum@@ mon@@ ed .
by means of the fake means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are confronted with a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide f@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ sustain@@ ing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
this has to be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be resolved swiftly and completely .
how the Financial Reg@@ ulations of Football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded spending of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules established by UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G will eventually prove that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer was financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid $ 2@@ 22 million ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to extract the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the rich royal family of Qatar .
clubs must invest a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be subject to legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their activities related to football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen out of favour of the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to dis@@ courage excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely increase the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , facing The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be recorded in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to outs@@ m@@ art their financial supervision by blowing up their revenue by companies tied to the owners of a club .
while a Q@@ at@@ ari company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of PS@@ G &apos;s payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could result in payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup Ambassador will be am@@ bass@@ adors and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could easily find out .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to avoid any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G through N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state sponsored by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is at a possible end : the airline is writing the order anew .
on request of the news agency S@@ DA , Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott also confirmed the report of the newspaper &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , some 17 million small red @-@ white packed shock panels spread to 14 grams per year before landing on passengers .
Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders value the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate maker it is a prestigious order .
the Swiss doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y the number of applicants with the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will endeav@@ our to renew the contract for the spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of co @-@ operation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are spoiled with goo@@ dies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class nas@@ chen passengers Sho@@ stak@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ eck of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short track , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distri@@ butes both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of the story is nostal@@ gic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( when the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a talking jar of vegetables speaking by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool kids , who will grow up - nevertheless they managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the casts principle , including a riff on the Trotsky@@ ist films of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
at one point , a character bum@@ ps through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a novel@@ ist , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot where Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ings of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; his former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy now feels like an old boy .
these are the moments of random ma@@ dness that could pre@@ heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I suppose to be his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his east versus West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers of Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lica , whose di@@ alo@@ gues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( another producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are syn@@ ced in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , like Americans might do it with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the ver@@ acity of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
in six long episodes , it pul@@ ls away , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who was edited for a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the District At@@ tor@@ ney General announced on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
German arrest warran@@ ts were issued against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are likely to be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crimes , violent acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office Con@@ stance has been investigating the organised drug traffi@@ cking in Southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had virtually daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the great use was also accompanied by four police officers from Palermo .
the investigation focused primarily on Italian nationals with a close relationship with the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , fired several shots in a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the gang &apos;s bank account .
Weise compla@@ ins large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners &apos; register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the representative for the refugee management of the German government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out that there were large gaps in the distribution centre register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the register , according to information , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data were not sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in some cases , data from 1921 had been found , &quot; of people who have long ceased to live , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register any more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in statistics on sufficiently tax@@ able people , EU citizens are also captured who do not have to travel abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such false attri@@ butions , however , led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they have arrived from there .
it emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paper says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came back to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 this practically no longer has been possible , so the paper is pointing to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they will reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to the Ein@@ rei@@ sel@@ and .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the office is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has substantially increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) consider these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also send back refugees there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ hand fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten to pose a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood was already available for other people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .

traditionally , the community pays multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood at the municipal council meeting .
&quot; it is brilliant as our body is designed for it , and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , even more un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the District Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could already benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported on the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Vice President of the DR@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it persi@@ sted interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members to increase in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure would continue to increase to household income , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but she sign@@ alled that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the cost of credit would probably have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut Business Package , which was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the upcoming February although it has been said that it is now expected to provide € 15 billion more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates , she repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than expected markets .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts revised down@@ wards for this year and next year are expected to rise by 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
she maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell in accordance with these news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change will come after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for an increase in interest and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has increased to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and marginal increase in wages , as the sharpen@@ ing becomes worse first before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the income drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the spark of the spark .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates has risen , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy decision @-@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and it will attract again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the exceed@@ ance in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be attributed to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ br@@ as , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in the swap rate , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those who run the existing deals and take out the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ formative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a high @-@ court fight against the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sex pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by health care via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the right to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be one of the first to make registration of people possible , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ operative pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in risk of infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will become £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , such as used in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful prevention of HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when targeted on vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Ter@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now has to be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV will be left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ atively this drug can be a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people living with HIV and that it will contribute to the termination of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living a big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my Ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sought something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to release the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed over each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to make it look longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering work went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne has gained an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the floor space - or how your property will be valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and that will help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meter by something standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide not to leave this .
brothers struggling for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute over one of Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s biggest real estate empire worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion on the separation occurs in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business on Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family West@@ co jeans founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owned property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him behind what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first affir@@ mation in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first court appearance took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , had excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early affir@@ mation that was submitted by Col@@ in he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with affir@@ m@@ kits , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property , in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ep shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he began with West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very shy , although he was a former member of the AF@@ L and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shri@@ mp of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior officers on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp White House that he wanted to repair : poor information that fell into the hands of the president .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diagnos@@ tic makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was angry due to unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advisor Sam Nu@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
political Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping Tru@@ mp Twitter habit under control , &quot; according to six ex @-@ election officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying fare . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp Twitter habit ever was under control is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officers know something we don &apos;t know , that Tru@@ mp T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
if his cow@@ or@@ kers managed to keep his anger away from him several times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently avoided that Tru@@ mp has spark@@ ed controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House that are composed of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that might promote their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and that he stiff@@ ens to figure out where they originate .
exactly that happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously announced a printed copy of an article by Got@@ new@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false alle@@ gations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
golden macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , &quot; says Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys &apos; mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals receive Post from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped .
the police across Europe sends out ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are naturally not known , evidence from the population is hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar of winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience showed that many pi@@ vot@@ ees were hiding on holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ want , more than 2.5 million times this was viewed .
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of evidence after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; Million@@ aire Range &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some resol@@ ute travelers on the base of the war , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ ors .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy road called Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire row . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by the tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; desert inhabitants have overcome the Council of Soli@@ hull that said it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to the pass@@ ers @-@ by by Bentley He@@ ath .
the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be named said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised warehouse on the territory beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible .
in order to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the former ambi@@ ance of the facility management company l@@ t@@ d. to 13th April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district , the hotel building was offered to the District Office as an accommodation for controversial discussions .
the city prevented asylum seekers from setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the location of the hotel and at that time spoke of serious prospects in the house .
he was right .
the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els group with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building construction sh@@ utt@@ les since a long time before the entrance , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are done .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ arranged , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later on , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a gem dr@@ one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
it would not be possible to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an elevated city level , Sch@@ erer emphas@@ ises .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to be broad@@ ly positioned , explains Sch@@ erer next .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel .
he already had talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director of tourism , Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver .
the city &apos;s ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he counts just under one million euros .
external installations are also being brought forward , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Issu@@ er sets Grand Jury
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special educ@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee resum@@ ed its work over the past few weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to persons entrusted to the Wall Street Journal .
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there were already the first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp El@@ test@@ em &apos;s son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have been deliberately mixed into the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller resear@@ ched whether there were agreements between the Tru@@ mp election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focused on several men who acted as consultants of the re@@ public@@ ans during the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller magni@@ fied more and more Tru@@ mp &apos;s private and business environment .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tru@@ mp had put himself in the centre and sought the accus@@ ation whether the president could have obstruc@@ ted justice in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to investigate the present evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether charges should be charged .
Grand Jury will therefore also be referred to alle@@ gations .
they are usually switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be sum@@ mon@@ ed by the At@@ tor@@ ney General to invite individuals to take action under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
those who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
next to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. was also Tru@@ mp advisor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting would show that Mu@@ eller does not want to be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act fast .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in order to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the Democrats a possibility to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his Special Ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but this usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any actions that ha@@ sten@@ ed the work of the special promot@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he won &apos;t be determined against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this cra@@ ck@@ down , alle@@ gations against Tru@@ mp have become lou@@ der , he wanted to im@@ pe@@ de justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a sen@@ ate committee , Tru@@ mp had asked him for setting up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material against the Sonder@@ er@@ ector and his staff .
this triggered speculation on whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller was released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired on the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday , after which the Special Issu@@ er could no longer be released .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ cti@@ ca , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely se@@ ven@@ fold size of Berlin solved itself from the shelf .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kol@@ oss , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion of tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now heading north and will probably need two , three years until it has melted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gi@@ ants registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for human beings .
according to researchers , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
however , for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapse of ice sm@@ el@@ ting in the region , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a background background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the previously broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ ard .
hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and regularly interrup@@ ts .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xes and breaking was disturbed some years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a complete shelf is broken down there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot to say about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is in danger , because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks down at a key location .
the melting of ice shelves and ic@@ eber@@ gs does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaci@@ ers flowing directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a limited extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is aware of , the ice shield is now entering a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf will grow back or fall back over the long term and may fall together , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these explor@@ ers do not return the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice sm@@ el@@ ands from the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long tip of the Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years and t@@ amed the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to house ari@@ f in personnel
because it becomes more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employers &quot; association to become more attractive .
only a few days before the summer break , 41 new jobs have emerged in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the municipal administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now only 17 trainees have their first working day .
the courses in the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were registered for the places to be played this year .
nevertheless , there is still a lack of personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are no vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the parties , the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should focus on the inside and outside , illustrate concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
so it &apos;s high time to act so that there are no more jobs left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , still go beyond the joint proposal with his party .
he caused a big surprise for a long time already in the circle @-@ day when he publicly challenged the personnel costs ceiling and start@@ led the other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be verified that enable a withdrawal from the municipal employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county administration should seek a house tari@@ ff in cooperation with the revol@@ ving cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually provides for the Public Service &apos;s tari@@ ffs .
the sal@@ aries are currently exact , increases or more money only exist if one changes to a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself in professional years .
but the tasks of the Circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy ag@@ grav@@ ates the tone to NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea have warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Minister of Home Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German relief organization &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; because their team had effectively co @-@ operated with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations currently being raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew includes din@@ gh@@ y ship migrants delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have above all an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; to their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who acc@@ ede to Italy &apos;s rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with the local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner Foreign Post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Northern Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were look@@ out points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again there was a look@@ out point at the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ at@@ y &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and huts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers entered the open @-@ air @-@ inhal@@ atorium cur@@ ative br@@ ine .
also Neu@@ stadt was controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres of altitude , the group got to know the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga Ch@@ ats for E @-@ Sport
will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium r@@ att@@ ling in wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gau@@ ges included .
this has also been recognized by the first German citizens who are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says managing director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are a lot of associations coming up this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal specifically with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will go into the stadium even in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the League of League to Asia .
what is it about ?
in e @-@ sports computer games like &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA will be cont@@ ested at competition level .
as in normal sport , le@@ agues have long been established in which the pros compete against each other .
and for the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses , which are also found in classical sport - for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes .
it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rob@@ ber also faces problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports .
players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study by the company consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and major tournaments .
in three years , sales will be at 130 million .
it is little against the almost 2.4 billion euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte Ad@@ vis@@ ors .
internationally , many countries are already continuing .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the European sports bet@@ ting company Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Netherlands and France , according to D@@ utt , the soccer league clubs are now oblig@@ ated to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ President R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing the old times is no longer enough today .

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for the neg@@ ligent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until vocation .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and face @-@ facing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have changed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they totally regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental disease had a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t w@@ rench the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it .
Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would be &quot; tra@@ cked &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; hang on , hop on a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; all you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter paid attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended the Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Mrs Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run the Audi Cup as captain is not a coincidence .
the Bayern Munich tru@@ sts the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not cause harm .
something else was different on his place in the cabin , that looked like Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made his rush to his arm .
&quot; the trainer did not adverti@@ se it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain .
good , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach was able to interpret Kim@@ i as well .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f consisting of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from holidays .
sugar l is best distributed to those you want to keep in your mood .
those who were chosen to inher@@ it the Leg@@ acy of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old scored as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
on the right side , that is his position , the white band@@ age on his arm did her rest .
and Kim@@ i worked at all in this starting point , like the one who can best take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had the view of the whole , while many others were occupied with himself .
Vi@@ dal w@@ rest@@ ling his lack of fitness ( not collap@@ sing ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus ki@@ cked out on the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( folded also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le not to fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
at least that worked out very well .
in addition to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy , Sü@@ le ran off the def@@ ences , both acted confi@@ dently .
the emin@@ ently occupied Nap@@ oli @-@ storm proved difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried to make a few times successful in the game @-@ building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how unusual the Bayern @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked after the game after the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but had six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said goodbye after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have noticed now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he no longer has to teach the new .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known foot b@@ aller spoke about Twitter shortly before the game and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wanted all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire is quasi Club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and looks fe@@ ather@@ ed with our ladies .
the we@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation sy@@ ringe .
the famous Bayern @-@ Dus@@ el might also need our ladies well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T @-@ demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time ad@@ minist@@ ering the old minist@@ erial portfolios .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; wi@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that has all blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot;
nat@@ us sees the biggest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
the Ministry is still hoping for a planning process this year , until 2021 the building law is to be established .
the West Bank also plays a role in the plans of the country , which is in the urgent need of the federal motorway network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Minist@@ erial spokes@@ woman Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees this as a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
Trier &apos;s Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) , as prompted by Wis@@ sing , asp@@ ires to the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to boost sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euros is provided for the passed master exam and 2500 Euros , if graduates within ten years after the master training themselves make themselves independent .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts are quickly to be made , at the same time it fails to provide the country with the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier .
so far only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to hire the Sage Masters of Wis@@ sing in the Landes@@ betrieb Wald .
the Chamber of Commerce ur@@ ges to award more orders to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U spokesperson , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the conservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it intends to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
furthermore , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is sober@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ating internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Gre@@ ens faction left Lem@@ ke to April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months , they already cleared the field for in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW Chairman said that the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving limitations , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a call@@ back .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ham@@ mer@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so @-@ called write @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , Volkswagen were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States before extra@@ dition .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft runs through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
those who prefer to go to Is@@ ar on Saturday will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the construction department wants to clear up .
on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding for the Is@@ ar is meant to be a worthy game of wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and again this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally responsible behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los K@@ id @-@ n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
at times , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons , the no@@ ble@@ men of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an still records and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he , among other things , suggested himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough in the late six@@ ties : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in &quot; Stern , &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found a lot of fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures are located in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own indications , he still sits at the table today , works almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his cute figures continue to spread much spread worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and TV series with his characters .
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - that has a jack of thousands as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film that is supposed to come on the screens of the cinema in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he relies more on the TV series , which , as his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened with climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the conditions that are remin@@ ding of drought conditions and insect @-@ borne insects , which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , are causing great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered as the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacterial , which transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have lower , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and evap@@ oration of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 anniversary this year .
the highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval feast .
in these days , Krä@@ mer , guil@@ ds , dealers , the vag@@ ab@@ onds or a landing gear store are to be experienced in the city centre .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , cor@@ rupted officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal pain range .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico a danger .
there is no rest of violence , and while the bodies are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection for attacks and threats until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wearing T @-@ shirts , showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ uth .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to rev@@ ise the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders committed every year with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried before court .
in Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is still more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little value , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we str@@ ust everybody . &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he was only able to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times it was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions struggle to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or more people are shot dead each day or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms , which are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first there was in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the competing cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after requ@@ isi@@ tioning another newspaper that had published the same history .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pu@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the spaw@@ n @-@ bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ workers , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was his love for the routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and remain alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their home run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the Land government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters consul@@ ted whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , which the governor himself was not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has printed on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Bo@@ xer , Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the Office of the Prosecutor , conducted a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite pub of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
only a few months earlier , the readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the most informed source of the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez office has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , which protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ bbed a few signs and went to a demonstration for another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor the next morning .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
in the whole country journalists have become lou@@ der by having written down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez bl@@ amed the authorities to spy on journalists and to leave them because they told the truth .
she has since asked her to be re @-@ classified by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; surrounded &quot; by organised crime , government officials and a uniform society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media guard group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border @-@ state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones sat next to her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va B@@ reach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z public@@ ally directed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug traffi@@ cking start@@ led him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and drank beer when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to h@@ um .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the edge of the board@@ walk , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a glance at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had had something of an &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described him as &quot; the mor@@ eto@@ ed ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has struck researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he gru@@ b on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 l@@ bs@@ . ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy Earth @-@ cla@@ ys .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you blin@@ king only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ burial , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to better mix into his surroundings and to ev@@ ade his enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7.@@ 000 hours to carefully disclose it .
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the peak of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong predat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs predat@@ ors have been in the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Age , &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including his preserved intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he fell on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland as they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved , sc@@ aly skin , but also stays in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early cra@@ yon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings are published in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house @-@ resi@@ ste lay still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a lot@@ to gain .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
its right front foot is on its side , its five fingers are spread upward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales on his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injuries , kilometres of straw and g@@ aff .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , between the connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) there were nearly 30 vehicles during a thunder@@ storm , among them probably trucks .
the exact number of the injured had no data at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of mild to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in direction of Munich .
in the driving direction of Munich , a backward jam of about ten kilometres was formed .
like an A@@ Z re@@ porter , there was also massive disabilities on the counter @-@ road - through numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade wrote down the license plates of the car keepers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive fin@@ es .
shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident scene .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
if the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many other remote routes in Germany in early next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; trains the ticket de@@ valuation without creativity .
in order to be able to use them , however , certain requirements must be met : a smartphone or tablet is required .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
you also have to purchase it from the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calling his ticket to &quot; My tickets . &quot;
for the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket inspection in place Y , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with already paid online ticket .
so you can sleep , continue to work , keep silent .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail - which in turn should be used for passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself .
this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr AG &apos;s marketing manager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who train often know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest off@@ ences .
because often one has , in any case , one of the fellow travelers not all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling their own tickets and the conductor takes time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other random numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on August 9 , 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only a day after she arrived in New York City , she sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolls through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ aned on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to tweet the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l with himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people scre@@ aming , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his gun and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we are used to and which we can call typically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter out of her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that consists of the perspective of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place facing the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said and noted that as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , it was President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration of Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism has been nur@@ tured by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We heard that people who were born and grown up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct prisoners .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other indigenous people followed the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team ? &quot; in the years to Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , for so I shall be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ el &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah @-@ leader but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; documents show un@@ expectedly personal aspects of Ferr@@ el &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like being naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ el &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; at which Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was on the front , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the news coverage in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long since disappeared , but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway in a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about Bit @-@ Gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping mall on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since its first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves one cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the Bit Gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while advoc@@ ates are building a gallery to attract more customers to the city from which the other businesses profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a square with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Rooms : &quot; we have been in the farmer &apos;s market almost weekly for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the country@@ women always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery res@@ ett@@ les , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is probably not the case with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s a shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I don &apos;t think that &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years .
since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies , as the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , there are almost no special shops and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmer &apos;s market hall go during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to drive all businesses out of Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this simply won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real estate market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - how I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place .
once the farmer &apos;s market hall gets broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , that almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly same - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having public@@ ally stu@@ ffed diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ form@@ ist and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from man@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , a shar@@ per , albeit a little intellectual commentary not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black and white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits comfortably on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just one of the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting the DNA from the tr@@ ash to produce an image of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal bone @-@ dogs , who exchanged several letters in the course of two years .
they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ lement Images , &quot; which was illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President would convert Over@@ seas judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama is actually only a few days after the book has been published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome type of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tru@@ mp runs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded with her super@@ large signature underneath ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; whose foundation is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respect , we are all .
&quot; what we hope will hopefully bring along is that our gen@@ ome isn &apos;t concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the comic novel mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears in the hands of the United States &quot; s discipl@@ in@@ arian barracks as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they cool your speech , then they won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came straight from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said of the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for Death
a nationwide chase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who will be sought as susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the files of the District Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Administration states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene and det@@ ectives are investigating the en@@ grav@@ ings as murder while police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ itt , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them was now in absence and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University is co@@ operating with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ itt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College stated in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he ur@@ ges susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious hint that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA Road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA Road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA Road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything was put into action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list however states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren regarding alleged state @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
talking to Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov existed problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal by the WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA CEO Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli announced that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for now

from now on only eggs can only be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on a fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ case solvent .

the start @-@ ups that will help your business not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people out of the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it enables companies to perform surveys , offer specialist groups and demographic groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaints hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow managers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys conducted by certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low compliance results - so that you can re@@ boot , why .
companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
he has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send tailored &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion collected Regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
if a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their company headquarters .
previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by managers living in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vit@@ rano said , who leads the risk management group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
businesses began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service , and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices heard , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and employee engagement , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee involvement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company take no action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 requests , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ LIN@@ T , Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; Vit@@ rano said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it starts at 11@@ pm , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice fields of the team on the campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these 10 minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Club the next morning at 6 : 30 a.@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 a.m. in order to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood went through practical exercises .
they are expected to hold 18 exercises during August . 20 before the beginning of formal play preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they continue to plac@@ ard , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been abandoned with foot@@ ball@@ ads , which will be a protective grid behind a gate pole , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts verification in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third parties fac@@ ebook inspec@@ tors and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false reports and send them to fac@@ tual veri@@ fiers that may be displaying results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan for social media networks to be punished if they fail to quickly eradic@@ ate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook shared a separate statement in German that a test of the new Fac@@ ts Review was launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by fac@@ tual veri@@ fiers of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the related article and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat in the Consci@@ ous River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shire with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the period from the Middle Ages to the era of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ el@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were itself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) this all seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape care , gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only granted full access until 2006 , when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent who possessed something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let everything go his way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , which the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the British Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century presented his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite Ga@@ un@@ er , always making debts and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men redeemed their debt crises by getting married rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with this dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf en@@ folds
with the exposure of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer we are well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , it stands in competition with other municipalities .
the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid five @-@ figure amount to cover its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pension plans and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week too .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
following the presi@@ dency of the He@@ ads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers took part in the discussions .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number .
the government tigh@@ tens the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the na@@ vy have been dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees the Erdo@@ gan as a driver of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has negotiated in Ankara this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the coup attempt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ iry in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among other things mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for female soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the major pur@@ ges in the army and security forces continue .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan fired up further 7@@ 3@@ 95 government servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als formerly func@@ tioned as the actual masters of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan forced the power of the military to step back step by step , not least by calling on the reform targets of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is pur@@ pos@@ efully driving an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; magazine , a notably non @-@ accredited officer who sought asylum after the attempted coup attempt abroad , the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
in any case , in the Alliance after pur@@ ges there are doubts about the operational readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media .
he fores@@ ees to lower the legal migrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining visa for temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by modi@@ fying the way citizens from other countries will be issued in green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English that have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race bus shuttle
over the past few months over the future of the racing platform shuttle has been cont@@ ested - now it &apos;s time to go very fast .
before the end of the year it is supposed to be built on the di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated track on which the tourist tram is running .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is scheduled to start this year in order to secure the future of the racing platform shuttle .
&quot; with the decision to further and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this , above all for tourism , &quot; said the Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
he estimated the cost of repair the route to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country ski@@ pped 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle will be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently fin@@ alized , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia train as operators are already unanim@@ ous about the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the racing bike shuttle will be ordered regular in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
during the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested over the past few months whether the route is used by a large number of people to re @-@ order them in the future .
the route is also very conspic@@ uous in parts .
the Ascension of Sex Rob@@ ots is real and we should worry about it
just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adapt &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot through the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xx Gold Sex robots , developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , trouble a most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their origin and increasing refin@@ ement indicate something Dun@@ lo@@ eres and Ti@@ efer@@ es in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their increasing popularity , they nevertheless remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what tran@@ spir@@ es out of the edges can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of the time in which we live .
and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the swal@@ lowed whole body and the exposed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to their personalities , the robots are not real women .
they can &apos;t separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no negotiation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are slaves .
or to express it in the expression of 2017 : maid service
Tru@@ mp great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to cope with the horror of Tru@@ mp @-@ choosing relatives .
we all o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly strain us to burst our filter bags .
less noticeable has been the power of crashing CH@@ mps , families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship , with whom she had fought for decades , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is in another context that this also involves considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tru@@ mp , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky way that his bi@@ bs will no longer rep@@ el us one day .
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to his standards .
today I find myself falling away from an active No@@ stal@@ gie for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ anium version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact seem to be one of very mild crimes .
when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be only mentally fit to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in town , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are hungry and the animals twist to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ spir@@ ing music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are getting old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
but the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ olds , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &quot; s and all have a great time .
if I could have rated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was sorry gr@@ in , while I tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to the hospital with chest pains from prison
Pist@@ ori@@ us , for the second time , left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was hospit@@ alized for the treatment of cuts in his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to which he suffered the prison authorities in a case in his cell .
as a result of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 , shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal inv@@ ader hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosecutor &apos;s Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools the four @-@ wat@@ chers were released from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen during the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of school liberation , the 29 pupils of the four classes led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young Eagle , who grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
in addition , the lively Sch@@ ar led a musical entitled &quot; Der Adler in the chicken farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and made it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a chicken @-@ k@@ not a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken ; the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les who bore cylinders to the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said school@@ master An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished for every quarter that he felt accepted in his new school .
there followed thanks to the colleagues , the former head of school , Michael Müller , who again and again jumps into obli@@ ging bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the time of the cu@@ cum@@ ber was over , explained class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she left her students only very reluct@@ antly after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .
finally , they were able to rely on the four @-@ quarters .
at the end , all students accompanied a song of summ@@ er@@ time and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally @-@ seated people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and put on anyone who is found wanting to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es .
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emissions behaviour of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE car Club Europe gives assessments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler reported to write to any person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done in its framework .
how long should the retro@@ fits go in total ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will depend on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we have seen , the autom@@ akers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would consult , so S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel .
the ace advises to wait with a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ orable .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar , who was announced with progressive TV series , already announced that she would refrain from attending the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - and to depri@@ ve them of the means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tru@@ mp to make clear of her views .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
previous prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life @-@ worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ sel@@ ch Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years , W@@ acker has been a city engineer .
and the work still makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press talk .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet met the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as the Lower House of Civil Protection , the applicant must demonstrate appropriate degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would no longer be able to fill it , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but close to the city is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , focuss@@ ing on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park are about to come across .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will take about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is great le@@ e@@ way for a city architect .
Has@@ lach &apos;s own farm and nursery can react very flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town is an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what works in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going urban architect emphasizes .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister also has a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of co @-@ operation and coordination for many years : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for the past 15 years .
also , that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker desires : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you would like to see Roland W@@ acker , according to the information from the town of Has@@ lach , a completed study can be presented as a diploma engineer or bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of planning and planning law .
the municipal building department sub@@ mits high and civil engineering , construction management planning , basic property management , administration of urban properties , urban depot with building yard and city garden , as well as under construction law authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : southern track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway routing in the area of Le@@ o@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were badly damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
near the crime scene , a ro@@ sy sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were seen by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes well beyond a Laus@@ itz kingdom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB announ@@ cer Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have put themselves in danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system as well as the delay of delay and the costs of railway replacement , the railway customers could also be able to access the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum should be taken out , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern railway line could be continued without any obstruc@@ tions .
almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday afternoon , two of which included the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall off , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recurring or bloody diar@@ rhea , weight loss , and extreme ti@@ redness .
while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contribute to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance supporting immune cell is found in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote more toler@@ able , less inflammatory bow@@ el li@@ eus when the same system is also active in humans .
the Post@@ do@@ k@@ tor@@ an@@ din Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separately accommod@@ ated , did not .
she suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice &apos;s intest@@ ines were sequ@@ enced and six bacteria species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but were missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers let L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us will protect L reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels in presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday night .
the 40 million Po@@ und signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the latest pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super @-@ Cup ki@@ cks off against Real Madrid on Tuesday and impressed in the pen role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which gave M@@ our@@ in@@ ho to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting three of four , I thank the club for doing so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; Pain@@ ting &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US State Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turned , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social Democratic prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only no distur@@ b@@ ance from the party central , but not a head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the election fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the co @-@ workers from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described with head@@ winds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were depths .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprise faction leader of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the Sunday election , its red @-@ green coalition thereby lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition of the CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Executive Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the back@@ sliding down @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens member El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear adul@@ ter@@ ation of the elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ NP must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and Leader of the Green Party in the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ ghing a party of the SPD , when on Friday morning the new embassy message reaches the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , Chairman of the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the transition of the green de@@ pu@@ ties to the CD@@ U without his own government majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the preliminary climax of a series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and nobody knows what comes next .
the failure began with the un@@ expectedly significant defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no more , cal@@ med down the com@@ rade at his time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
then it became - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te swept the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously ti@@ ring up in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just dar@@ ed new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was coming from Hamburg .
and with him came the next swing .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because after that he made everything wrong in crisis communication about what one can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust arrangement and its role on the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now .
the survey results were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just because of this , Wei@@ l was getting stronger in the past weeks to set accents in the Con@@ federation .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained un@@ concealed by comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they let him go , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no fault at the party &apos;s internal purpose of the Lower Saxony Green Party .
and Mr Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , comrades struggle to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the back@@ sli@@ dden parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ al v@@ ests .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ est puts her own career starter food on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ v@@ est has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but on the national list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , so the Lower Saxon Parliament continues .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters of four years ago were clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD in Lower Saxony into the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career gift of a future CD@@ U member is fal@@ si@@ fying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for the centre III
those who want to renov@@ ate his home in the years can soon get support from the country .
on Wednesday , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Town Development informed city development on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler had a look back at what happened so far .
since 1991 there have been in sens@@ ations areas of rehabilitation .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the total amount of funding .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is important to promote internal development and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on 4 April , the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the total amount of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros would come from the country , the rest from the community .
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could then shift again .
the bridge was represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programme in which the refur@@ bish@@ ments would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure .
the measures would be made object @-@ related , i.e. per property .
the rehabilitation area would then be defined as a statute .
the approval period for the funding has been running until April 1 , 2017 , until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September of this year , however , it would only take place once the inventory takes place , within the scope of which the participants in the rehabilitation area get a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the amend@@ ment should be made as soon as possible , so that the refur@@ bish@@ ments can start next year .
after that , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every commun@@ e had to carry out the said preliminary examinations .
it is about assessing the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art gri@@ ev@@ ances and deciding when to be remedi@@ ed and to what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a remedi@@ ation note in the land register .
once again Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come to his senses and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ ovina also stressed that a key success factor for the project is the involvement of stakeholders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there will be questionna@@ ires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and property sheet , &quot; where it deals with , among other things , the structural condition and the restructuring prospects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and apartment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on the size , layout and inhabitants of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled when business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve to development .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of funds in accordance with the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - whoever comes first , grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the project , photos of the project &quot; Centre II &quot; were shown in order to make a &quot; tasty &quot; rehabilitation possible for those present .
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip in order to come in house and car with a hand movement

the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights U.S. production last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military given to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Navy One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior official of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , made in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was exhibited beside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire truck from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the Military Office of the White House requested the presence of helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with great visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the Deputy Military Command for Aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3@@ pm and stayed until the tur@@ f was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the flight departure from the White House was delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the confin@@ ement of the service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the recordings provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt the appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event the president gave a push for the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Navy One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but its use only for a photo operation is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation when the presidential jet provided his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often runs training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 training courses in the White House .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pa@@ yers took the load for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates of the tax rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND survey from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it .
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky job
the championship leader of the Second Tennis League ki@@ cks off at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will kick off at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V tomorrow .
despite the five games still imp@@ ec@@ cable , the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained a sense of reality .
in any case , team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that is always playing in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the S@@ V , the S@@ V mainly imports from the high North .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is becoming difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also need good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man is currently active in the Chall@@ enger tournaments in the Italian Bi@@ ella tournament , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec will be his first bet in this season .
the hitherto un@@ defe@@ atable Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ three V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky and the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should also be present in Kiel , as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ shoulder , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories over the past Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move to the team .
if it is enough for the 18 year old Hungary who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the train@@ ee around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay will fill up the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp did not really feel happy when he put his signature under the law on Wednesday evening to intensi@@ fy sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress added some &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US initiative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plan to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of domestic O@@ MV are wor@@ rying , which co @-@ financed the construction of the North Stream 2 Russian Baltic Sea together with other European companies .
the threats are enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions even per Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos revealing Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars &apos;s killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed their attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise &quot; only operate with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ co will begin on 1 September .
roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aid
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over food supply in the municipal children &apos;s care centres ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is kept out of the house : a cat@@ erer is responsible for this task and co@@ ols down freshly cooked tea .
the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
during the last year of kit@@ esur@@ fing , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is constantly growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are looked after 45 hours of the week in the day@@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen service from September 1st : they heat up the delivered food , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , portions the meal individually , fill out the food , clean off , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chefs are now firmly committed to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital leadership to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it &apos;s also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is reasonable .
even for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen , also has the charm that it has found itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ regulation and foreign allocation for the city as the most economical one , it is called the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are newly set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at about 750 people in the educational field , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ son , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential election will take place on 5 April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban has published threats against a election process that coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , the elections for the first time will be transferred to the next government peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl on Thursday .
according to police information , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 a.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .

G@@ MB alarm about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant in Glasgow at managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company out@@ weighs the future of investment at the cross @-@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which besides other products Plan@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies are produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s director , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s asked to &quot; express concerns that financing for modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of cross cross is deeply concerned with our members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and labour power strongly concentrated on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a flour@@ ishing product presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross got a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to this because we value the continuous commitment to employees and union representatives .
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with colleagues and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic climate , we continuously monitor our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our cross cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we fully appreciate the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our operations are changing at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know this . &quot;
was the PS@@ G Barcelona warning three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga likes to regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t surrender in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after having given an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his exemp@@ tion clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United during the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Council insi@@ sts that the club always did his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereas the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G central field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
roller kno@@ cked and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown off@@ ender had intentionally dis@@ car@@ ded a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property no . 30 , causing damage of over 200 Euros to the fair@@ ing of the vehicle .
the police force Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for clu@@ es .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because he had a car in his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au to Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on Thursday evening .
in the vicinity of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him on the road , so that he had to devi@@ ate to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the crash barrier .
property damage occurred on the passenger car .
the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident .
according to the accident damage , it can be good that the driver did not notice the accident at all .
the police now ask witnesses of the incident and the driver of the prisoner &apos;s vehicle to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report is reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report on the ab@@ uses is reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ are , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are the Church , &quot; after the publication of the German press agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the cathedral conductor Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the retired Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false assessment of the processes at that time .
on the other hand , the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that the reporting of violence against the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was &quot; double standards . &quot;
in respect of the ass@@ aults in Regensburg , nobody doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and this is a &quot; fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows had been a normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of the abuse cases , the pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
totally wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who wrote the book &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ zek@@ iel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the clari@@ fication commissioned by Mr. Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of assault , 67 domains of dom@@ esti@@ cated cats .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases , physical and psychological violence was used by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
especially with high emotional appeal , the punishment for the students could be heavier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , many victims over@@ estimate the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even have even positive memories of him in spite of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen George R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. E@@ zek@@ iel , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence exercise on bene@@ fici@@ aries of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became pal@@ p@@ able to the public , if a dom@@ esti@@ cation did not bring a top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in there at all .
he is dedicated just once eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ awareness among the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool took place outside of his sphere of influence .
at best it is possible to reproach him , to know from it too late , or to have taken first indications seriously enough .
from practically all the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es , the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus the vast majority of his pup@@ il Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which sometimes led to rage erup@@ tions .
that he not only kn@@ it with chairs and kno@@ cked the keys on the ground , but also distributed ear @-@ cow@@ ards and attracted too che@@ ek@@ y guys to the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced it in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one is already wondering if it &apos;s not to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media just r@@ ushed to him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many who have never understood him are still busy .
but the truth is that the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , the report reports a great deal about the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in the final report Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also accused of any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
none of the 67 victim of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to be entrusted to the domain master .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one concerned representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was all very embarrass@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us leader who , in a professional sense , would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
what is the evaluation of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in the context of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student expressed it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective off@@ ender .
I think it ... even for really absurd to assume that it is calculated to him ... to have opened more intru@@ sive resp@@ ite or more clearly than against their parents , boarding managers , teachers of tru@@ sts , etc .
that one talks about sex with him ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment infected him in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is to be acqu@@ itted of all co @-@ workers .
so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an adver@@ t .
therefore there is no reason to link its good name to these vile crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non@@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of taking a look at the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the reporting to a huge ban from sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this again is a mis@@ use of the report .
it is separated clean@@ ly : between the pre @-@ school and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence , and , we say once , other repro@@ aches .
the report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were har@@ assed and painted , and suffered horri@@ bly , all took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the cathedral gym@@ nasi@@ um .
on the other hand , as most of the witnesses stress , the subject &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; is t@@ abo@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and even &quot; paradise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the gym@@ nasi@@ um gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even in spite of violence , even bring positive memories to him . &quot;
at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then only around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger just shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the primary school the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when test pen@@ alties were also banned in Bavaria .
before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate the extent to which the people affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permissible limit was actually exceeded .
but one cannot say that he had always looked away .
that &apos;s not right .
only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall@@ acy of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating past and present moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is quite right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which has been ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and not for what has been viol@@ ated in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that of the past .
this is all terrible and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I must take the protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipline and punishment , so ear @-@ cow@@ ards and ears and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when a physical punishment was banned , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My Brother the Pope , &quot; what is the picture of his time in Regen@@ s@@ burger ?
was the subject of punishment imposed also in the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , that the domain @-@ cats played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not at all conc@@ eal that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but that also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the requirement of un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscuits and candy alone , from un@@ ru@@ ly boys , one does not once have a great singer and before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and experience again and again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep @-@ gra@@ cious , deeply beli@@ ever and hear@@ tless people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could also do just one fly .
I regularly get in touch with how many former home j@@ uries still today , 23 years after his retirement , keep in touch with him regularly , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him until today , that he was once stern to them , are thus un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally in the minority .
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he was always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect , to which they still look up and honor them .
and please , once more clearly : all that you are accused of are education methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
the evil intention behind it is only too obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the stand @-@ up area , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally get in peace .
