<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-institution, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "small gardeners are cultivating the former cause of farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, because the car navigation device showed a green lawn instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but that is why it is very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large map of the map, more detailed maps, so-called initial sheets, were incorporated for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian distribution management between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria on behalf of, of course, for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops were finally drafted with the Peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV moved the project further, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and therewith the Bavarian surveying administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The information sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of former / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered flutes from the so-called "Ursus" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are no farmers in small plots there, but small gardeners of the plant "Land in the Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the sheet of documents, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "on the Gasteig" or from the hill "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "on the Auer Ventitet" in 1858 / 59.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, finished the cigarettes of the so-called Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had been plagued, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity did not suffice any more - the reason for the construction of the circle division in hair in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet at Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">The football field of the TSV Munich East lies west, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural style based on the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was registered as "Main Square" around 1856, the shopping street was called the "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs raged many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn regular track takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes Travel forecast for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The national union for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, scheduled to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for special attention to African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri, as a number of questionable, rapid-based incidents occur throughout the country and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed Bill of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that disproportionately target minorities, led the group to issue the warning message, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights, people pass." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints about such a frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the voyage through the state and was put into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from Missouri's office in Missouri, which is shown to be 75 percent more common in the state than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," "" "" "" "said Chapel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people must be willing to bring a deposit or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI investigation programme, which classifies the state regarding the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to the ACLU's view of further race profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have acted as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Grassroots project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishermen Weidemage project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter White and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fisherman CDU-village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Pivot Graveyard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insight into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young as well as accommodates in five apartments holiday palaces.</seg>
<seg id="72">For him, the "Black Forest milk" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengaeste there is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "" "" "since he is also the chairman of the BLHV chairperson, he called the" "" "" "" "elementary important" "" "" "" "project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot produce profitably on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "" "" "stressed Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "" "" "the Commune has recognized the significance of the grassroots project and is glad about the leadership development." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is those who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation," "" "" "" "said the mayor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of them were promoted by leaders, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers had to spend 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of pasture-fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of fences," "" "" "" "explained Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and women." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "Peter White also stated:" "" "" "" "here the best foods are produced." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg will enable the state support of the fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area must not be tractor-resistant (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a fence of just 16 kilometres, is currently underway for the Fisherman Weidezaunts2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The surface area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President for the drastic restriction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty creators would have heard him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he resorted to their importance, and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "" "" "the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is really correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites an old immigrant, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, and the miserable fall of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "" "" "there was never a time when the" "" "" "" "miserable waste" "" "" "" "was better to see on our screens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of liberty in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neoconservative who brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It shall carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrific journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not lighten the way, but inflame the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the British team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship "will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>

<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butier - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m stretch while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team as team captain.</seg>

<seg id="143">"" "" "" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally included were great." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it's "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir takes this path and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman for watching after a great season, which included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots, which belong to the team." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: do not entertain you for a public office if you cannot tolerate the citizens of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He smiled at the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this very beginning of this week." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the action as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heatsink.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his constituents and play his hair-less head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum designated as official and paid for by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-professional.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not filled with water but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "" "" "she wrote in the commentary box" "" "" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous times, if one had done the same that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence the demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise that he has insulted Facebook and other social media.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That shouldn't be so hard.</seg>

<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck him on his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>

<seg id="428">At present 455.000 of such non-binding reservations envisage, in a telephone conference with analysts one.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not on demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">2018 - all models will be collected - 500,000, 2020 a million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 bookings are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a model 3 can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines that are never tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum occupancy.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if there is too much delay, then the non-binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.</seg>
<seg id="439">EPA boss Pruitt withdraws because of delaying the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the environmental protection authority, took back his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive than previous administrations to the needs of the state environmental authorities.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the suit filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">A deadline was set for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the following year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or to hinder economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed on blocking or delaying regulations which resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prusion regulatory rollback agenda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA often neglected the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be accused by activists and others, and in an agreement setting the deadline for carrying out," Pruitt, who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

"" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive collection of ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet voted in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York General Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the reversal of EPA - according to our lawsuits - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumbling celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the church, the old cemetery area in Tumblings will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters of Tumlinois a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "" "" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "" "" "it is a unique village gem." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische Register of Documents: count Hermann von Sulz "sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document according to the certificate, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, which belonged to the church or the patronage right and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there too.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumblings, the "mountain" of the third, the lord mayor of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied himself with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was accompanied by the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two fell on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed out later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed and the bell rings were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumour Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the Turmzwerg existing today remained as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are the successor of Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">On Sunday, July 16, the Friends and Conveyors of Tumlinens invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler University of Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann speaks the closing words.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">To conclude the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "" "" "the organizers provide the fantastic view." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of importance for turmoil and deaf-teleconers.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and sponsors of Tumlinois are particularly committed to home care, such as the Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Boisheim resists" "" "" "" "does not see any legal precondition for construction and therefore has turned to the Landrat." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="506">The Boisheim Foundation is called on by Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheim Nette, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration camp existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration camp, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exploitation of wind energy for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "" "" "such zones should prevent" "" "" "" "recess" "" "" "" "of the landscape." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had approved a second wind power concentration camp in the Boisheim Nette just a few days earlier - but this had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district government due to a form failure.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore withdraw," "" "" "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four each 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>

<seg id="534">As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced the "home-shopping" weekend should sensitize customers to what offers their own city holds apart from the usual supermarket goods.</seg>
<seg id="535">According to this plan, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>

<seg id="544">In addition, customer potential is to be opened again or again.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals lost sight of the city centre while shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city centre - to landlords, companies all over the city and clubs.</seg>

<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in Steinfurt in the furniture store, once a week I will help in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in the open whole day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with that?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it's a nice, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">You are now 26 years old, so a late-time volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British education group Pearson said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its dividends by 72 percent since another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.</seg>
<seg id="720">The reduction in job cuts, which was predominantly announced by General Director John Fallon by the end of 2018 and early 2019, is in addition to its previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs were already lost.</seg>
<seg id="721">In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) in a third cost-cutting program to revive a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="724">A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="725">Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, divided a statement by NATO.</seg>
<seg id="726">According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the Qaragh district.</seg>
<seg id="727">The bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="728">On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="729">In a statement by NATO it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="730">The statement says that all injured are in a stable state and be treated in the U.S. military hospital on the Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby district.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian fatalities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="733">At the end of July, suicide bombings killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Taliban said they had done this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On May 31, a massive bombings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadliest military attack in the country since the US-led forces forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="736">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump considers to increase the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="737">Correspondents say that in recent weeks the suicide rate in Kabul caused a crisis of public trust to the government, its policies and, in particular, to the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="739">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has annulled a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, according to which states are obliged to contain the smog-causing emissions. this took place a day after 15 states acceded the agency because of the step.</seg>

<seg id="743">A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the Municipality of Colombia, filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="744">The government of President Donald Trump has tried to drive a broad range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="745">However, efforts have triggered the setbacks of democrats and nature protection groups that are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.</seg>

<seg id="747">Community wants community space</seg>
<seg id="748">In the end, the decision was clear: in two opposing votes, the community council of fluorn winches decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion there is an important information: the sales contract for the still missing piece of land is signed, reports the mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>
<seg id="750">While the church community is still a part of the community, there is now no obstacle for the project to be stemmed by a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common room for this.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the Municipal Council prefer not to foresee such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the senivy-just living, but openly in the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="755">"" "" "" "as an example, the word" "" "" "" "knitting café" "" "" "" "made the round." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="756">The decision, which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, will be decided by means of funding.</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is located in the rehabilitation area.</seg>
<seg id="758">According to Tjaden, the establishment of a common space would be eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposed resolution is that in order to signal the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw a billboard between the legs, the statement that both saddle - which is leaning against the surrounding building - as well as the roof-roof - which reduces the height of the pitch and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer writes that this addition.</seg>
<seg id="761">If it helps: unanimously, he passes the committee.</seg>
<seg id="762">It's not that easy with the common room.</seg>

<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidy of investors anyway, or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface one does not give a subsidy, but receives a real counterpart in doubt, is the counterfeit.</seg>
<seg id="767">Stay's request to split the resolution accordingly finds three proponents.</seg>
<seg id="768">This is how it remains with two opposing votes in the original program, which Stefan Haller sums up: "if we handle the decision, we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of the Swedish asylum-age review tests published</seg>
<seg id="884">The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of tested people are older than 18 years. however, not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Ministry of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They should take a closer look at the age of asylum during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were under age.</seg>
<seg id="887">To date, Migrationsverket has sent out 6,880 cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older, whereas in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "" "" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "" "" "possibly under 18 years old." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "" "" "" "he said the journal The Local." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said there are 442 cases that "suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays are made of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological ripeness of humans to see if they were usually going through puberty sooner or later.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"" "" "" "if we cannot safely say, we should not do as if we could," "" "" "" "he told the newspaper Metro." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="901">However, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "generally, you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is low.</seg>
<seg id="902">"" "" "" "the biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="903">Full in the plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a load of seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good in time, it runs great," "" "" "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Building and Traffic at the Government Presidency of Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is planned for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a peripheral fixation, which is also used as operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2,20 metre wide bridge deck is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that these are finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip feeling has required laying cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable, connected to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">In the run-up to the work the local residents were informed about the project.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collecting area in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is governed by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">The road in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance.</seg>
<seg id="929">The costs for the three breedings amount to 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="1091">The Minister for Agriculture, Christian Schmidt (CSU), is in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) and answer.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Schmidt, How can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?</seg>
<seg id="1093">I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1094">On the consumer protection portal www.grocery warnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs batches.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Financial Regulations of Football affect Neymars Moving to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules established by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid $222 million ($262 million) to extract the Brazilians out of their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs must invest a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must be subject to legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their activities related to football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP moved from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen out of favour of the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to discourage excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely increase the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, facing The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be recorded in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by blowing up their revenue by companies tied to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could result in payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have contested that Neymar World Cup Ambassador will be ambassadors and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could easily find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The current sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to avoid any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG through Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They said under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state sponsored by an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," "" "" "" "Wenger said on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1156">"once a country has an association, everything is possible.</seg>

<seg id="1159">In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet cooperation is at a possible end: the airline is writing the order anew.</seg>
<seg id="1161">On request of the news agency SDA, Swiss-spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott also confirmed the report of the newspaper "North West Switzerland" of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "with the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied," "" "" "" "said the spokeswoman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1165">Every year, some 17 million small red-white packed shock panels spread to 14 grams per year before landing on passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders value the volume of orders in accordance with "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: for a chocolate maker it is a prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss doesn't want to betray the number of applicants with the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey will endeavour to renew the contract for the spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of co-operation with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long-haul flights, the customers of the First Class are spoiled with goodies from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class naschen passengers Shostaki by Lindt and in Economy Class Schoeck of Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year-Grunge-era (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael Show alter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001 before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humors (it contained an original story for a talking jar of vegetables speaking by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By sticking to the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play cool kids, who will grow up - nevertheless they managed to win back the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults, who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more to the casts principle, including a riff on the Trotskyist films of the 90 "s like" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. "</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character bumps through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-vicious plot where Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sublippings of "Singles," his former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of random madness that could preheat this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I suppose to be his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even at "GLOW" with his east versus West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers of Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulica, whose dialogues from Channing Tatum (another producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synced in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags for watching (the police spends the time watching chess on TV, like Americans might do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde the voice out'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is very committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">In six long episodes, it pulls away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," who was edited for a lower length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, because Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a banquet.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1290">NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September following a high-court fight against the funding of the drug in the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that pre-sex prepositional prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by health care via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the right to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England CEO Simon Stevens as "important new intervention" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "decisive moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be one of the first to make registration of people possible, and further clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preoperative prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will become £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive purchase.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, such as used in a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Stevens said:" "" "" "" "this great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful prevention of HIV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">"" "" "" "it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1307">Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep, when targeted on vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many lives.</seg>

<seg id="1311">Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terence Higgins Trust, said: "the priority now has to be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV will be left behind.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living a big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I sought something comparable to my price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one bedroom property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to release the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "" "" "he explains." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "" "" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for function above or below." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a bit of engineering work went in," "" "" "" "explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneered MDF door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is important so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne has gained an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or how your property will be valued," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and that will help create emotional ties in a home," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "" "" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meter by something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers struggling for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victorias's biggest real estate empire worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion on the separation occurs in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family Westco jeans founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owned property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him behind what I thought for the best objects," "" "" "" "he wrote in a first affirmation in 2015." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1368">The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, had excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.</seg>

<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with affirmkits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property, in which Colin opened the first jeep shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he began with Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Shrimp of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior officers on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump White House that he wanted to repair: poor information that fell into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnostic makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," "" "" "" "said the former election campaign advisor Sam Nuunberg in February against Politico." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">Political Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump Twitter habit under control," according to six ex-election officials, insists that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying fare. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump Twitter habit ever was under control is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officers know something we don't know, that Trump Tweets would have included even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his coworkers managed to keep his anger away from him several times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently avoided that Trump has sparked controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House that are composed of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with humiliating leaks, and that he stiffens to figure out where they originate.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February when someone maliciously announced a printed copy of an article by Gotnew.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter because of chicanes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false allegations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Golden macher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork," says Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys' mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the former ambiance of the facility management company ltd. to 13th April 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district, the hotel building was offered to the District Office as an accommodation for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented asylum seekers from setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>

<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller magnified more and more Trump's private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump had put himself in the centre and sought the accusation whether the president could have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to investigate the present evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury will therefore also be referred to allegations.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are usually switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be summoned by the Attorney General to invite individuals to take action under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Those who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Next to Trump Jr. was also Trump advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former election chief Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting would show that Mueller does not want to be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act fast.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in order to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "" "" "said Trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "" "" "the theme gives the Democrats a possibility to" "" "" "" "feel good" "" "" "" "because they have nothing else they can talk about." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His Special Advisor Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this usually works in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the White House endorses any actions that hastened the work of the special promoter" "" "" "" "fair" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he won't be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because of this crackdown, allegations against Trump have become louder, he wanted to impede justice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June in front of a senate committee, Trump had asked him for setting up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to US media, the White House collected material against the Sondererector and his staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation on whether Trump Mueller was released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, as in the Watergate affair around the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired on the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "several Senators of both parties want to prevent such a step." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented legislation on Thursday, after which the Special Issuer could no longer be released.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Antarctica, a giant iceberg of the barely sevenfold size of Berlin solved itself from the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Koloss, weighing over a trillion of tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now heading north and will probably need two, three years until it has melted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice-giants registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapse of ice smelting in the region, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a background background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The previously broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelcoward.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Horseshoe swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and regularly interrupts.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf the balance of waxes and breaking was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a complete shelf is broken down there," "" "" "" "writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say about the fact that the Larsen-C ice shelf is in danger, because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks down at a key location.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelves and icebergs does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers flowing directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a limited extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is aware of, the ice shield is now entering a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "" "" "he also confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C shelf will grow back or fall back over the long term and may fall together, "said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these explorers do not return the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice smelands from the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and tamed the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to house arif in personnel</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes more and more difficult to fill vacant places, the CDU asks to step out of the employers "association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only a few days before the summer break, 41 new jobs have emerged in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the municipal administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now only 17 trainees have their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The courses in the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be played this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, there is still a lack of personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are no vacancies at the Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "" "" "according to the parties, the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to not only cover short-term needs for skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should focus on the inside and outside, illustrate concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "" "" "the speech is a" "" "" "" "competition of the public employer" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So it's high time to act so that there are no more jobs left unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter peoples, leader of the CDU, still go beyond the joint proposal with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He caused a big surprise for a long time already in the circle-day when he publicly challenged the personnel costs ceiling and startled the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people want all possibilities to be verified that enable a withdrawal from the municipal employers" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the county administration should seek a house tariff in cooperation with the revolving cities," "" "" "" "said peoples." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually provides for the Public Service's tariffs.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exact, increases or more money only exist if one changes to a higher level, which orientates itself in professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the Circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy aggravates the tone to NGO migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea have warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of Home Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organization "Youth Rettet" because their team had effectively co-operated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very sorry we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "" "" "said the organisation in a statement on social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can only judge any accusations currently being raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew includes dinghy ship migrants delivered directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers can take off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have above all an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessarily, but acceptable, as they would not bring "essential changes or disabilities" to their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti now said that the number of migrants who accede to Italy's rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and co-operation with the local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "" "" "said the Minister." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Foreign Post" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the Northern Palatinate for four days to enjoy Trials and sightseeings.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were lookout points, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were repeatedely longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day there went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again there was a lookout point at the lookout spot, connected by "floaty" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days many altimeters were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers entered the open-air-inhalatorium curative brine.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through the stadium rattling in wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">This has also been recognized by the first German citizens who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent E-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the League of League to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sports computer games like "League of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA will be contested at competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sport, leagues have long been established in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And for the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses, which are also found in classical sport - for example increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability.</seg>

<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, hop on a building, get yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad" and "all you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."</seg>

<seg id="1708">In addition to Kimme, Rudy, Süle ran off the defences, both acted confidently.</seg>

<seg id="1725">Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: economy praises Wissings</seg>
<seg id="1726">It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T-demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time administering the old ministerial portfolios.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies (VTU), says: "wising attacks the desires of the economy that has all blocked Lemke."</seg>
<seg id="1730">Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">The Ministry is still hoping for a planning process this year, until 2021 the building law is to be established.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The West Bank also plays a role in the plans of the country, which is in the urgent need of the federal motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="1733">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020," "" "" "" "says Ministerial spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1734">Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional, but internationally competitive companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">Trier's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK), as prompted by Wissing, aspires to the wine of a Rhineland-Palatinate-Label to boost sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German exports for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the Chamber of Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The Handwerkskammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new master bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.</seg>
<seg id="1738">A premium of 1000 Euros is provided for the passed master exam and 2500 Euros, if graduates within ten years after the master training themselves make themselves independent.</seg>
<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">With the planned road construction, facts are quickly to be made, at the same time it fails to provide the country with the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the IHK Trier.</seg>
<seg id="1741">So far only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers, who want to hire the Sage Masters of Wissing in the Landesbetrieb Wald.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The Chamber of Commerce urges to award more orders to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">Christian Baldauf's CDU spokesperson, Christian Baldauf, points to calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the conservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank natus also expects a concept of the country as it intends to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">Furthermore, the previous broadband expansion in the country is sobering.</seg>
<seg id="1746">In 2016, regional companies had only evaluated the grid supply in an IHK survey with a score of 3.4.</seg>
<seg id="1747">They complained about stagnating internet connections and outbreaks.</seg>

<seg id="1750">Audi to change 850.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counterreaction</seg>
<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options as driving limitations," and thus moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a callback.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers to install systems for neutralising exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of hammering the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so-called write-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, Volkswagen were indicted by Volkswagen and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States before extradition.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1777">At times, Mordillo was one of the most publicized cartoons, the noblemen of his characters are his trademark.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "" "" "his message: laughter," "" "" "" "For there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he, among other things, suggested himself as a draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "" "" "he once said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough in the late sixties: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then in "Stern," and other leading magazines all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found a lot of fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures are located in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own indications, he still sits at the table today, works almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Over calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and clocks, his cute figures continue to spread much spread worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and TV series with his characters.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - that has a jack of thousands as a counterpart.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film that is supposed to come on the screens of the cinema in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," "" "" "" "says Mordillo." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender threatened with climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to the conditions that are reminding of drought conditions and insect-borne insects, which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, are causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered as the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a microbacterial, which transmits dwarf-cades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"" "" "" "Eric Chaisse said:" "" "" "" "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have lower, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and evaporation of evaporation from the ground, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200 anniversary this year.</seg>
<seg id="1807">The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval feast.</seg>
<seg id="1808">In these days, Krämer, guilds, dealers, the vagabonds or a landing gear store are to be experienced in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupted officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal pain range.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico a danger.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection for attacks and threats until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "" "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wearing T-shirts, showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahuth.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to revise the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders committed every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried before court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is still more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little value," "" "" "" "says Ibarra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we strust everybody."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He was only able to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times it was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot dead each day or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kingdoms, which are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First there was in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the competing cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have angered the sons, presumed aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own security after requisitioning another newspaper that had published the same history.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want to continue to live," "" "" "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "" "" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "" "" "is a way of life," "" "" "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompuviento-TV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you must take over the task you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the spawn-bird, who could curse like a dockworkers, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "" "" "now they ask:" "" "" "" "was his love for the routine his ruin?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and remain alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their home runways," "" "" "" "to move drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">Days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the Land government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters consulted whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, which the governor himself was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has printed on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxer, Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the hometown of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the Office of the Prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite pub of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the most informed source of the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "earlier we knew what happened," "" "" "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "" "" "El Flaco" "" "" "" "because of his slender body." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, which protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration for another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country journalists have become louder by having written down in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez blamed the authorities to spy on journalists and to leave them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be re-classified by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organised crime, government officials and a uniform society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media guard group "Articulo 19" accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "" "" "" "said Ramirez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border-state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones sat next to her separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publically directed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled their home country or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said that she had had something of an "restless past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the moretoed armored dinosaur who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"" "" "" "his incredibly well-preserved condition has struck researchers who describe it as" "" "" "" "really remarkable" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 lbs. (1,100 kg) heavy Earth-clays.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blinking only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant-eater, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-burial, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to better mix into his surroundings and to evade his enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was named Borealopelta Markmitchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours to carefully disclose it.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the peak of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that dinosaurs were hunted by eating meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have been in the Cretaceous Age," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he fell on his back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time Alberta was as warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland as they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved, scaly skin, but also stays in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early crayon." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just shoot a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings are published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mummified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant-eater was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house-resiste lay still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a lotto gain.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, between the connection points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) there were nearly 30 vehicles during a thunderstorm, among them probably trucks.</seg>

<seg id="1977">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a matter of mild to moderate injuries," "" "" "" "said a police spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the driving direction of Munich, a backward jam of about ten kilometres was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Like an AZ reporter, there was also massive disabilities on the counter-road - through numerous gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade wrote down the license plates of the car keepers, who now have to reckon with sensitive fines.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 6: 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>

<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident scene.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: you sit in the train and sleep.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffered.</seg>
<seg id="1990">If the conductor comes and wakes an unsuspecting or rips the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and validate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test run runs on two tracks.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if the offer arrives, we will expand it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "" "" "it is expected to be available on many other remote routes in Germany in early next year," "" "" "" "said a railway spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" trains the ticket devaluation without creativity.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use them, however, certain requirements must be met: a smartphone or tablet is required.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You also have to purchase it from the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: one climbs into the train, calling his ticket to "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">For the test customers, a button for the electronic devaluation appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train attendant arrives at the ticket inspection in place Y, he knows that a passenger is sitting there with already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can sleep, continue to work, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the rail - which in turn should be used for passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel without ticket inspection by our train attendant, check out the DB Navigator yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr AG's marketing manager.</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "" "" "second plus:" "" "" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who train often know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often one has, in any case, one of the fellow travelers not all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling their own tickets and the conductor takes time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Other random numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only a day after she arrived in New York City, she sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolls through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18 year old child and it's still on the street," "" "" "" "said it there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweaned on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is wild," "" "" "" "thought Ferrell with himself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to Tweets on people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "" "" "in another video, she said, another policeman said his gun and screamed:" "" "" "" "I will kill you all." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not common," "" "" "" "Ferrell remembered her statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we are used to and which we can call typically." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "" "" "I was angry and wept." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the perspective of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell, with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "" "" "she remembered what she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that was not right." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "" "" "I could not take them away," "" "" "" "said Ferrell later." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "" "" "I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from them." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place facing the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after August 9," she said and noted that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, it was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "" "" "it's all come." "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration of Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "" "" "a question came to Ferrell:" "" "" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism has been nurtured by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview, "We heard that people who were born and grown up in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestract prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other indigenous people followed the Whose Streets team? "in the years to Browns's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," "" "" "" "Davis said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "that was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, for so I shall be represented." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrel's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah-leader but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, "Whose Streets" documents show unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrel's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I felt like being naked," "" "" "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and the dehumanisation of black people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrel's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "" "" "black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an affirmatical type of action," at which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she was the person who shook this energy," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is no accident, although it was on the front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">"" "" "" "you can feel their energy through the screen." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news coverage in Ferguson has long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about Bit-Gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in proponents and opponents since its first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves one cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the Bit Gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no human being" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While advocates are building a gallery to attract more customers to the city from which the other businesses profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been in the farmer's market almost weekly for many years.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive.</seg>

<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>

<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a real estate market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the unbelievably many - how I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no more place.</seg>

<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after having publically stuffed diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Stresemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transformist and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from maning and created from the 30 portraits, a sharper, albeit a little intellectual commentary not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie in which Manning obviously sits comfortably on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just one of the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the trash to produce an image of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal bone-dogs, who exchanged several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a Comic "Supplement Images," which was illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President would convert Overseas judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama is actually only a few days after the book has been published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome type of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump runs a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her superlarge signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end of the "automatic fragmentation," whose foundation is gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological respect, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what we hope will hopefully bring along is that our genome isn't concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears in the hands of the United States "s disciplinarian barracks as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if they cool your speech, then they won," "" "" "" "says it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so never stop your mouth." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it came straight from a letter that she wrote to me," "" "" "" "said the artist who greets Philadelphia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulations, which assemble like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also target-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for Death</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who will be sought as suspects after a man has been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as the files of the District Court of Cook County show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago Police Administration states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the engravings as murder while police are actively seeking the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubitt, Vice President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now in absence and excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious hint that said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the reintegration of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>

<seg id="2188">One of the criteria listed in the list however states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian attorney Richard McLaren regarding alleged state-subsidised doping in Russian sports.</seg>

<seg id="2192">Mutkos words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">Talking to Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov existed problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful, or even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people out of the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it enables companies to perform surveys, offer specialist groups and demographic groups, provide employees anonymity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow managers to bypass the C-suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys conducted by certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low compliance results - so that you can reboot, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain, so that you won't be the next Uber that has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">He has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent companies can send tailored "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of Public Opinion collected Regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has used Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their company headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers living in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed faster, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "" "" "Vitrano said, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Businesses began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer their software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and employee engagement, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee involvement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but the data are useless if the caretakers of a company take no action." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change doesn't come fast enough or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 requests, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for if you don't follow employee," "" "" "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "" "" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported on GLINT, Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry that is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and if you lose people, you also lose customers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, then you will lose business.</seg>

<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 a.m. in order to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood went through practical exercises.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's.</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pension plans and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">This week too.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as formerly, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Following the presidency of the Heads of Government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers took part in the discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus the civilians in the YAS were in number.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government tightens the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army, mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees the Erdogan as a driver of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 persons who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has negotiated in Ankara this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">"" "" "" "already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt" "" "" "" "God gift" "" "" "", "as he gave him the opportunity to" "" "" "" "fully clean" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unhairy in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which among other things manifests itself in the abolition of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the major purges in the army and security forces continue.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan fired up further 7395 government servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as though Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals formerly functioned as the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they appealed to their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Following his victory in 2002, Erdogan forced the power of the military to step back step by step, not least by calling on the reform targets of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say that Erdogan is purposefully driving an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the "Vocal Europe" magazine, a notably non-accredited officer who sought asylum after the attempted coup attempt abroad, the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists in a few years."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, such a development could not leave Nato cold.</seg>
<seg id="2363">In any case, in the Alliance after purges there are doubts about the operational readiness of the Turkish army.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for race bus shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Over the past few months over the future of the racing platform shuttle has been contested - now it's time to go very fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year it is supposed to be built on the dilapidated track on which the tourist tram is running.</seg>
<seg id="2376">According to the Ministry of Transport, construction work is scheduled to start this year in order to secure the future of the racing platform shuttle.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further and rehabilitate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this, above all for tourism," said the Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">He estimated the cost of repair the route to about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Of this sum, the country skipped 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, on which the shuttle will be ordered also in the future from the country, is currently finalized, declared Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringia train as operators are already unanimous about the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this means the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are traded," "" "" "" "said Sühl." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This means that the racing bike shuttle will be ordered regular in December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">During the course of a pilot operation, it has been tested over the past few months whether the route is used by a large number of people to re-order them in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The route is also very conspicuous in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The Ascension of Sex Robots is real and we should worry about it</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "" "" "but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" "" "" "" "personalities" "" "" "" "that would make a stepford woman progressively." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxx Gold Sex robots, developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personages like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," "" "" "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can" "" "" "" "be in mood" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape if one goes a step on Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, trouble a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxxy?" "" "" "" "says it on the website." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and increasing refinement indicate something Dunloeres and Tieferes in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they nevertheless remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires out of the edges can be very instructive regarding the spirit of the time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the swallowed whole body and the exposed eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to their personalities, the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can't separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no negotiation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the expression of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trump great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to cope with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all ostensibly strain us to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticeable has been the power of crashing CHmps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican relationship, with whom she had fought for decades, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is in another context that this also involves considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the spooky way that his bibs will no longer repel us one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalizes" which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to his standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself falling away from an active Nostalgie for Mitt Romney's uranium version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be one of very mild crimes.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must be only mentally fit to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are hungry and the animals twist to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perspiring music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are getting old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city is not just the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the TopPub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as there are two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40 "s and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was sorry grin, while I tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius moved to the hospital with chest pains from prison</seg>

<seg id="2452">As a result of murder, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of the Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal invader hidden in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Hasselch Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For 31 years, Wacker has been a city engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he communicates in the press talk.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has yet met the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In this way - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the administrative community as the Lower House of Civil Protection, the applicant must demonstrate appropriate degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would no longer be able to fill it, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But close to the city is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2561">Also, that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker desires: "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you would like to see Roland Wacker, according to the information from the town of Haslach, a completed study can be presented as a diploma engineer or bachelor's degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of planning and planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contribute to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna stated that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance supporting immune cell is found in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerable, less inflammatory bowel lieus when the same system is also active in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separately accommodated, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice's intestines were sequenced and six bacteria species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that a intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan-Metabolism known as an indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent, but if the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us will protect L reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan levels in presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2679">On 4 April, the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a redevelopment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The total amount of funding amounts to 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 Euros would come from the country, the rest from the community.</seg>

<seg id="2691">Until September of this year, however, it would only take place once the inventory takes place, within the scope of which the participants in the rehabilitation area get a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen Report on the abuses is relieved by Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what the author and historian Michael Hesemann writes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnare, spokesman for the reform movement, "We are the Church," after the publication of the German press agency, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburger Bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret about their own omissions or their false assessment of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that the reporting of violence against the Domspatzen was "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="2895">In respect of the assaults in Regensburg, nobody doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we are happy to go to the church and this is a" fresher. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "" "" "blows had been a normal pedagogical means" "" "" "" "to deal with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, the pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Totally wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes, who wrote the book "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "" "" "says Ezekiel," "" "" "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the clarification commissioned by Mr. Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausibility" victims of assault, 67 domains of domesticated cats.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that in many cases, physical and psychological violence was used by Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotional appeal, the punishment for the students could be heavier.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "" "" "nevertheless, in contrast to many other defendants, many victims overestimate the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even have even positive memories of him in spite of violence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen George Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Ezekiel, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence exercise on beneficiaries of the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger's Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "" "" "for one, many students emphasize his" "" "" "" "humanity" "" "" "". "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as choleric and perfectionist, which became palpable to the public, if a domestication did not bring a top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in there at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated just once eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-awareness among the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the excesses of violence at the preschool took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best it is possible to reproach him, to know from it too late, or to have taken first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">From practically all the interviewees, the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived as "salvation," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus the vast majority of his pupil Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "honest," "sincere," "competent," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which sometimes led to rage eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he not only knit with chairs and knocked the keys on the ground, but also distributed ear-cowards and attracted too cheeky guys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced it in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are certainly Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One is already wondering if it's not to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many who have never understood him are still busy.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is that the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, the report reports a great deal about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the final report Georg Ratzinger is also accused of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victim of sexual assaults claimed to be entrusted to the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "" "" "said one concerned representative for the others," "" "" "" "I was all very embarrassed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus leader who, in a professional sense, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the evaluation of Ratzinger's role in the context of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student expressed it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective offender.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... even for really absurd to assume that it is calculated to him... to have opened more intrusive respite or more clearly than against their parents, boarding managers, teachers of trusts, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks about sex with him... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "so the report concludes with a clear result:" "" "" "" "that the students and / or their environment infected him in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be acquitted of all co-workers.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an advert.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link its good name to these vile crimes, as unfortunately occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "" "" "in the media much of" "" "" "" "nonviolence" "" "" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of taking a look at the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the reporting to a huge ban from sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this again is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is separated cleanly: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence, and, we say once, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were harassed and painted, and suffered horribly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the cathedral gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the other hand, as most of the witnesses stress, the subject "preschool" is taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "" "" "one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and even" paradise "" "" "" "" conditions. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even in spite of violence, even bring positive memories to him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then only around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger just shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "in this he points out to this," "" "" "" "that in the primary school the punishment will continue to be practised." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when test penalties were also banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate the extent to which the people affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was actually exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "" "" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "" "" "we are talking about the" "" "" "" "fallacy of Anachronism" "" "" "", "i.e. the danger of evaluating past and present moral standards." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorred at all times and not for what has been violated in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that of the past.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take the protection of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of discipline and punishment, so ear-cowards and ears and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When a physical punishment was banned, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">In the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope," what is the picture of his time in Regensburger?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of punishment imposed also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, that the domain-cats played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not at all conceal that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the requirement of unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, from unruly boys, one does not once have a great singer and before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger really well and experience again and again as a wonderful, humorous, deep-gracious, deeply believer and heartless people, from whom you can't imagine that he could also do just one fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former home juries still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in touch with him regularly, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today, that he was once stern to them, are thus unequivocally in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect, to which they still look up and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that you are accused of are education methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The evil intention behind it is only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for the report, which was just published, relieves him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the stand-up area, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally get in peace.</seg>
