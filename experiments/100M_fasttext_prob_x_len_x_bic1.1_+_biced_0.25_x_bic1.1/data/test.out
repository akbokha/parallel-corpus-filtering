28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the court medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations were running .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank lived initially in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
his way of combining with his family was to cook something for us , to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of argument .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ one every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the sign post of the SF@@ D under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always being put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston should not always be perfect or successful .
that &apos;s what the Hollywood star has made clear in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or stuck out labels from the outside that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .
the act@@ ress prefers to spend her time at home , in front of the television with a lot of de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is no children &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a little change with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remember their holiday , they hun@@ ted home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and then the riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he sat down with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even go for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , silver lau@@ rel leaf , champion @-@ tour @-@ player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already filled it up .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is also awarded for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents .
and so he also gave the prize money of EUR 25,000 .
with 15 outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports on Saturday .
the recorded include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the former Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the drummer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the legendary rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ous of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of those sporting legends had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion where the lava price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept a distance from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp economic policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
the two US presidential competitors , however , are un@@ one in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental principle .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental philosophical difference .
the one on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep those in doubt small and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he himself would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will reti@@ re from regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities for dis@@ advant@@ aged and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , it says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invest in that must be invested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tru@@ mp and Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic candidate is even announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the government @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
in Tru@@ mp , however , internal discussions could still be made .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tru@@ mp plans to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate agreement will be announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , explicitly wants to extend and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign them .
at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should be paid even better , for example Clinton asks .
the present minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point out that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and its critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen four women sit .
each one has a baby , that is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he gaz@@ es curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is watching .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a social suppor@@ ter in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in Munich &apos;s north in one of the few de@@ centralised accommodation for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Children &apos;s Aid .
it was recently officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten to torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ bear@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who thinks that the end , when they arrive in Germany , er@@ r , tell B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that around 90 percent of women resi@@ ding in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not volunte@@ ered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what they have experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodation needs only for them , B@@ ahr requests .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the detention of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing as accommodations of the governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians , fle@@ eing women are not lod@@ ged separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or private houses for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be lod@@ ged separately by men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy , or are men and women resi@@ ding together , can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
how much women can feel this need of protection can be read out at the request that is available on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily set up a second house .
assistance doctors strike : demands for new work combat activities
representatives of the assistance doctors called on their union to approve new work combat activities in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to approve more work combat activities from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers had agreed to deal with concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained &quot; calm &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and requested official re @-@ negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC committee today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work combat activities that begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that this year , assistance doctors were struck six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Regi@@ strar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election for ref@@ using the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students that the contract should be advantageous and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile appeared narrow @-@ li@@ pped and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for its restra@@ ined conditions .
Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something terrible happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ fall of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin stri@@ pped and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend .
building the c@@ ous@@ ins again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks had to blame for everything .
most serious were alle@@ gations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria territories controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he disputed that v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan who he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved of his office last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually take several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they are based on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West as it considers the reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the continued gru@@ dge of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian head of state gained a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow that itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , as an analy@@ st once described , to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently given itself the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents expressed at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched the subject .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to stress it .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it almost collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be saved .
in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumer brands .
she supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus on more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank trademark is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the retail business that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .

he divided Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor &apos;s brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we are not pursuing global goals , but local objectives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the probability of the different brands in their sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , for how do we focus within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these stamps .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see a lot of changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Rem@@ ove ction
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he put a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
there is no big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ er when he brings the victory to Ex@@ otic Fri@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career paths
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma delight fans for years for this kind of sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already won 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
in the UK , Frank@@ ie already suffered almost 30 years of winning , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades now .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form .
and he &apos;s not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ s .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ j Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ j Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of the narrow@@ est confidence circle of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed special Commissioner for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without giving reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resignation of Ivan@@ ov@@ s has been ordered by his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been the pro@@ xy since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin website it is said ( in Russian ) that he was later Chief of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state on bills of bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin announced to the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked for leaving his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has taken Moscow into a mysterious place .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin who was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ns on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president to initiate the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , this very complicated post - you could almost say - compla@@ ining about four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin , former member of the Security Service , K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term of office , as a third term of office would have viol@@ ated the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest ally Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
last month , Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination of the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced in a joint statement its termination .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son is written out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be released at a later date , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been part of the series since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a communication published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible now .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a show .
the planned broadcasting of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28th .

Que@@ ens@@ charter Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck@@ b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 be@@ vel ropes .
the project , which is worth £ 1.@@ 35 billion , is to be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fitting .
all in all , almost 79 % of the entire deck deck is in its place and the last section of the deck now gets a g@@ ong for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone for every bridge project .
this fantastic project is the closure of future @-@ oriented high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the existing northern tower , we had to close the gap on the north or the landing page .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station was aler@@ ted on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and presented us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot @-@ engine had an emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded from the person who was steering the boat from the person who was steering the boat .
someone today w@@ akes over these men .

who is building cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , investors should be much more accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you respond to bad news that in the coming years Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments ?
the SPD will propose a &quot; Action Plan Home &quot; at the next council meeting .
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
up to now , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , those who want to build on urban areas must reject 20 percent of all homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built in stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main point in the town hall is that Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and needs to be financed , is intended to provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left wants even tough@@ er jobs for investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter how viol@@ a , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the programme is not complete : the 12@@ 60 new apartments that were to be built anyway .
how do you compare the loss of other around 1300 apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 homes .
in order to prevent this , according to the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , now pending ties from the city should be purchased .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring back homes back into the price relationship .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
at the end of the year , the western city dates back to the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price binding for affordable apartments .
only : this is not what the owners want , the housing companies do not want .
because if the number of social housing in the western city is increased drastically , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged people in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens assume that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must be in a boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although this has concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
that teenagers and children no longer go out to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , was lam@@ ented by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it is great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course , I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created first for video games in the 1990s ( later a series of animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell slightly at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ em@@ on which are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( over a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the run@@ way and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day .
Cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees raw data for improving performance .
many public health awareness campaigns that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active everyday &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people looking miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide it here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close up new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also gru@@ mp@@ y game spo@@ il@@ lovers who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have already been able to track our activity before , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade away with time .
however , due to Pok@@ é@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help many people in hunting to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the ladies &apos; ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
bril@@ li@@ antly brilliant .
and now finally also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast blossom@@ ed on Thursday for the championship title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the balance beam during the individual competition for women at the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ hah is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins majority and the fifth , while consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey took an end at that moment .
this achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ a has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was awaiting her last examination in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment .
the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual competition for women at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i , who retired from reti@@ ring , served as ex@@ clam@@ ation mark on the farewell party .
although Bil@@ lie insi@@ sted , during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , that &apos;s not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which include their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit in the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
that is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gym@@ nasi@@ um , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since summer 2013 , it has not lost any competition competition , a winning series that will last as long as it wishes .
although Mu@@ staf@@ ina was slightly guided by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
Swedish Kni@@ ves and Dan@@ es - in which Bil@@ esh holds the world title - watched .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and put one on top with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her final b@@ ail - a pure form@@ ality - and tears streaming on Bil@@ es glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that she once described in her collection book became a reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; by the Americans , has a lead .
after their down@@ fall , she cast down kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ esh , the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mass kill@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks in Phoenix when they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots out of a hand@@ fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that belonged to one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not un@@ common for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the sho@@ ot@@ ings which had been sam@@ pled on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with a micro@@ cephal@@ ic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time was my first thought , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I can &apos;t do that .
I did not take care of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and you have been told that under certain circumstances Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycle rides .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
Micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic , like Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of infected infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds us of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that anyone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives cause to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to call for emergency on Friday . it will be expected all over Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flood their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards shared with the fact that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , told us that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the village of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while it was ra@@ ining in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flow in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a threat , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ re@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still sent people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , is rising overnight .
he said that another step son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water stre@@ amed and stre@@ amed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there she had never seen such a high level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ ester had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there were still severe ra@@ ins and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation directions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the rainf@@ all has been much more complete since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and road floo@@ ding caused rescu@@ ing residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and school ou@@ tage in five school districts .
the WW@@ L , a subsidiary of C@@ BS reported that an associate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated into two churches , both of which were now flooded .
the leader of the Rob@@ by Miller commun@@ e said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed away from the flood .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were built to accommodate ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets were closed because of flood water and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to participate , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ acy Land@@ rum said about the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooded , but on Friday they were not reported .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police reports that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shots , including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital at his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was shot at the front of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
as a investig@@ ator , C@@ BS Philadelphia par@@ ted that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ cked back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , approached the crime scene .
it seems that this was definitely an ongoing battle .
on the road , on both sides of the pav@@ ement , they were located .
this is how it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said the police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were also met in the area .
there was no arrest and police reports that the surveillance video was reported .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cri@@ cket by her arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ covers himself and the police still looks for a suspect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ onship in the gym@@ n@@ ast and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I joined every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison &apos;s Ko@@ cian , which is Catho@@ lics , rounds off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise winner of the Olympics .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they provided unexpected but master@@ ly gym@@ n@@ astic routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual competition for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see turn@@ tables in the whole country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gym@@ na@@ sts primarily in private gym@@ n@@ astic clubs which are maintained by parents for training , training , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily .
the majority of these trainers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both of her athletes ever since they started with the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to provide the municipalities with countless young girls , who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access gymnas@@ tics training .
I founded my gym@@ nasi@@ um of 20 years ago .
at my events we offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( mainly black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high quality gym@@ n@@ astic , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body , as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by bringing the Olympic team gold and thanks , you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their journey to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors would like to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers were hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes caused by the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors voted for a vote rejected it .
in July Hun@@ t &apos;s plans had revealed to forci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and that any further delay would be detri@@ mental to the employees and patients .
the first assistance doctors will receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend dates in order to improve the care at di@@ ast@@ al times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ sted Doc@@ tors , announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it is going to heat up the current occupation crisis and treat it to all doctors . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty , progress has to be made and time is running out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BM@@ A &apos;s efforts towards resol@@ ving disputes caused by the government to engage in opposition and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was one of the promises that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made until the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now , raise the attention and address the concerns of the assistance specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he fails to do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat activities .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to provide coverage to doctors on the stri@@ k@@ screen chain .
the ministers were hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ end@@ pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not achieve anything but burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to the Committee of the Assistance Medicine and responded positively to the concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training sessions , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were in compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ e@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is already administered for 12 months following a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot causing the flow of blood to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ al@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Evaluation Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ al@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes among people who have had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes election fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today .
the former member of the cabinet , Sir Eric Pick@@ les , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town councils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off tapes outside of electoral districts to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should carry out an identification card in order to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a vot@@ er just has to name his name and address .
the report proposes that non @-@ removable ink should apply to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone from selecting twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against election fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ let election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
last year , a special court ruled that the reign@@ ing mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be removed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which a person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed particular interest in the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters , in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system including the leadership of ID cards to prove the identity
in his report , it is stated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to vote according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions were ignor@@ antly ignor@@ ing such behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric mentioned 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists process brief@@ ings to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory to be used for migration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing to your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone el@@ ects twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic selection of letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition of political activists to process full let@@ ter@@ press and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police give the authority to set up barriers to electoral stations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change in the law which facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the &apos; People &apos;s Act 1983 &apos; of the People Act 1983 .
photograph@@ ing prohibited in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule out the rule that voters go alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no complaint was made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the town councils &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , which has proved to be an impressive double @-@ fle@@ er of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by no means the only athlete competing for gold that has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , on the left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ates &apos;s Doppel@@ gänger on the race track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ pro@@ mi could be Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the U.S. squ@@ ad in Ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a strain on Twitter after pictures showing the wolf of Wall Street Star amaz@@ ingly similar .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got ins@@ anity in social media and admitted that he had already heard from childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity , except facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes will be able to pass through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user feels that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ er@@ in@@ in
another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mann who showed similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blonde hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resemble an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face and face .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Gym@@ nas@@ tics Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swimming teacher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig has died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis on the 4th place of 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at 4x@@ 200m free @-@ sty@@ led pool emp@@ tor@@ ed viewers of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
the Canadian station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese rac@@ er &quot; like M@@ ief lived off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he dis@@ covers his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ sty@@ led squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; color &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited , as low as low , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese bu@@ oy@@ ant Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the Flo@@ ating Squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
audiences across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the tone and language
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ eting , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pig has died &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ di@@ ot did not realize that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China has been described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter was fast and hard , in which many of him questioned him .
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let all of us look like ra@@ cists . # applied .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who was moder@@ ating the C@@ BC mission , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , we are sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC , at the end , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in the people who responded to the comments about Twitter
the commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about the comments of Mac@@ don@@ ald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and posted a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly to our audience on show and our comrades in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on it as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an unhappy choice . By@@ ron is very sorry about what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the mission and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Flo@@ at in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark reb@@ elled against woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back to the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman gra@@ bbed the under@@ pants before they put it back on the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear she came back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled off their own stock@@ ings and trousers and proc@@ eeded to try them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she was just there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled off the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like as they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other pants before she finally decided that she did not like anything , got up again and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem disturbing anyone observing - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how absurd to think someone would take home trousers having another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull out the clothes after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and she wasn &apos;t washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident happening in our branch in Folk@@ stone on Tuesday , 9 August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video by Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you get closer to you from behind , you should turn around first so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the firing line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee in the gro@@ in and rotate , while the attack@@ er col@@ li@@ des with pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while they direct the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to hand over your money - provided that you are not a Mag@@ a Grand Master .
traveler Ian W@@ right sch@@ wit@@ ts for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British traveler underwent a serious examination by det@@ ecting some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a toilet button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
prior to the lick of each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he will let himself be .
but the experiment which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought of stopping the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a toilet which has already been used by thousands of others may be totally re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left him , which he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public money to railway stations to washing @-@ up kno@@ bs of toilets , the task put his immune system defini@@ tively under a sample
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was justified in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample line showed a lumin@@ ometric number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th , &quot; which shows the bacterial count at different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune system .
senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended saying that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he would lick some of the things I had instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others , with whom this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing supplements containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 , because they terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in irre@@ parable condition .
the walls had perfor@@ ated holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls .
the family has been moved around and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , since this property is thought to be considered not as nic@@ er as any Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror inflic@@ ted by the family , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cries , disputes and floods came .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up
neighbours testified that they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ers were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , testified that it would have had the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called periodi@@ cally for 20 years .
garbage and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house
he added , &quot; It is a shame that the ten@@ ant had agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the final step considering Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the ground
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household servants will now have to remove garbage mountains surrounding the house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don got a fine after it had found itself guilty of possession of a drug of class B in commercial indul@@ gence .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will navigate tenants who do not adhere to the rules of the house
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pan@@ i@@ cked after an eff@@ er@@ ves@@ cent military jet flies on the beach
sun@@ ba@@ thers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the Air Force made an incredible flight
the Air Force reported that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no risk of security
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after having a flying jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the sun worshi@@ ppers at the beach section in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped on when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the D@@ warf gear@@ boxes , without seeing first what came through the clouds on them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos on the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane crashed on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were stag@@ gered as the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to the poor visibility due to poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk .
surface fires have destroyed part of the Portuguese mainland this summer , in which four people died on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly as deep as possible due to the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke , which limits his view
the plane was on a training flight where pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with concerns about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is the first step to win the title in the new soccer season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the battle for the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ meister has to do without the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europe @-@ league champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who is riding the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , there is also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
in practice , the German suffered a change of lig@@ ament in the knee , with which Bar@@ ca &apos;s request was clari@@ fied at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique ren@@ ounced a clear decision in this regard so far , leaving Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen is the leader in most of the other competitions .
before the first mandatory match of the new season , the Spanish master has doubts about the fitness of the team , which was humili@@ ated in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 on Saturday .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced of the 3 : 2 at the pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sev@@ ille again has the 2 : 3 defeat after extending the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims to win the second triumph at &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in its own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
with this the world @-@ ranking player scored the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the Final Game and made the title one another .
thus it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympia stand was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , between the sentences and time @-@ outs they didn &apos;t have a coach .
they retired to the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their guns on their own in fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the match up to this place I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly single @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight only in the first set with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang on only 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless enough stunning balloon changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ zor@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had contracted a rib@@ bed injury , and then in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were , by the way , a similar high table tennis holder Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp eliminates &apos; huge problems &apos; in the campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has now identified weaknesses of his campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ scale and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed as much concern as concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts start to grow in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have enormous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty were false reports of his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media shift .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ le
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey carried out by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tru@@ mp and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were syn@@ onymous .
other institutes see tru@@ mp in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the broad@@ caster CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered the question how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will either be successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no difference to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tru@@ mp is said to have threatened to er@@ ase funds for the support of his campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey values .
instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be stronger than the poor .
Olympia : three sc@@ ams at the dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C aims to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village Kenya has sent a trainer to his home .
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had informed that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , submitted a urine specimen in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this was reported to the team leader Kenya of the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has requested IO@@ C for information on the case to ex@@ ert its own investigation into an IA@@ AF spokesperson .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the follow @-@ up measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will evaluate it , &quot; said IA@@ AF in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and described himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , released and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan &quot; Ath@@ le@@ tics &quot; leader Michael Rot@@ i was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation after numerous dop@@ ing contracts at the IO@@ C for some time now .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Olympics , it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency held a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
as a consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have been raised again and again that dop@@ ing drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it was possible to prove that in this sport area was widespread and systematic .
as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games .
the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; the fun@@ nel Bern@@ st@@ eins Haupt@@ werk .
the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled her with the role of Mary as a teen@@ ager .
the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members her love with Tony , while the younger Maria is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for him , conducting is a necessity .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; highly topical : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ver@@ cans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
these are the same topics and they are as meaningful as ever .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British girls left in London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ne@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death a few weeks ago in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in this - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from eastern London boar@@ ded an aircraft to Turkey and subsequently boar@@ ded a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton would remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of electoral victory in Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the de@@ ceased judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he was expecting Gary from Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for Rei@@ d said later that he had not yet talked with Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge of the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ per workers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to have a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s and Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ude calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mers to bring out Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boy distinguishes itself as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the opinion that the calendar also does .
&quot; we have to return to the exposition of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness , in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally with open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community with mass ex@@ odus
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in short , the Kur@@ dist@@ an community of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protective seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the hard action of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dist@@ an community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with hundreds of thousands of protective seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had already over@@ drawn Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal off@@ enses three months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing in Turkey .
after the pois@@ oned coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state who receives refugees will produce refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comm@@ anding staff compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Algeria cities .
in this way , Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the export pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or expelled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comm@@ anding officer called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire mark as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , is seated on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; world . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , calling on numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks had already set up the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany before the coup .
on the reporting date June 30 this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all recognised as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there are not those who face war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign fight - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
they have understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
in 2021 the Sunday election will not be held right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament decided already at the beginning of the year .
because more stupid than previously it &apos;s not possible : summer holidays , heat and land bal@@ dness struggle - that bites .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so do not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count voices in the end .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and the last holiday days , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let the election campaign run over itself almost by the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party ever since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly Neul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains in the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ able .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from his large posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary word @-@ called predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
apart from that , Se@@ ering got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Angela has the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaign at the right time at the right time .
she has invited Angela Merkel twice as Chancellor Angela Merkel to large demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s electoral district is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania recently compla@@ ined in the N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s a pity not to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that , so means Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has noticed that you crum@@ ble the base on the land , that it has to be very hard to find a wire to the people again .
like the Left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , you hardly exist in the expan@@ ses of the country .
the advice of the CD@@ U @-@ elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert to his co @-@ workers is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the social democr@@ ats last 22 per cent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD won a clear 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Green Party , with seven percent in the poll@@ s , is likely to make the leap into the land tag .
they make a modern virtue out of their holiday necessity and largely reloc@@ ate their election campaign to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the national pres@@ idents Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , green election fighters embar@@ k on searching for domestic vocal ch@@ ords among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffering from closure
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for construction , starting at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and ending at about 8@@ pm , there are all praise .
&quot; they did everything pretty well , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready .
it is also commen@@ ded to the mutual benefit of those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to the establishment of expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site has mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the citizens can now travel from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ev@@ asion through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some serious complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ mann Street , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas fran@@ ke .
as the speed limits were not adher@@ ed to , the municipality increasingly called for the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant over@@ ri@@ fts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who himself was able to inform himself about the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have already been two to three per minute .
the fastest was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that the street is now open for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to break@@ through@@ s in these countries makes everyone who wonders to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ ership , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also acknowled@@ ges that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running documents are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most shaken are the local restaurants along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only it , but all the restaurants I met &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to be happy about every Euro turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates the sales revenue for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; road marking had its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , with the advice given , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much more funding has been handled .
for all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
it can be understood that other regular guests are less frequently visited because of the complicated traffic flow .
if you cannot come here , it is also very nice elsewhere .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his regular clientele comes back to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work is brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of the fight against terrorism is constantly scre@@ wed on in laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a debt status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ vers@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically unacceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior during the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are demanding no one .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also involved myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior he was on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère did a little time before presenting his conclusions for the safety of the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security agency is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on air passenger data and ce@@ ase@@ fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second approach for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship bon@@ ing the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still believes this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance with the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
they sometimes have it in themselves : he is planning quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees that are targeted into the country should check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of D@@ ul@@ dings for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as commit crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally sanc@@ tioned .
some still seem un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the perpetr@@ ators of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , given the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that people were deeply involved let themselves not be cl@@ inging out even during election campaign times .
the inner security is hu@@ gely put into focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly turning their attention to internal security issues .
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only a gar@@ nish conflict about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security @-@ political ideas @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resort leaders also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
also here de Ma@@ izi@@ ère struggles here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he does nothing of a return from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ plen@@ ish it is not expe@@ dient .
and in the case of a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for the coalition partner , it has to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things that could cause stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is also trying to gain a footh@@ old in the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
despite the diesel sc@@ andal , the number of delivery numbers increases worldwide .
but it &apos;s not in all markets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recall action , there is a term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vor@@ tex &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
Volkswagen is starting to conduct shipments in the second half of the year as a result of deliveries .
although Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can boast a further advantage over the course of the year , despite the diesel level , thanks to its many brands and a number of well @-@ run markets .
but in July Volkswagen felt weaker primarily in Western Europe , and consequently loaded the sales as the company listed in the Da@@ x segment .
in July , the VW brand sold cars with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market Germany , deliveries fell by almost a sixth .
according to the sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , the weaker figures from July were mainly due to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been restra@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ type was first escal@@ ated , another minus is also to be found .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected family brand of Lower Saxony is already lightly damaged by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is only one delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales chief Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sales increase from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software exhaust gas testing .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
after retro@@ fitting , the car manufacturer issued a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called in business circles on Friday .
the reason is j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen now offers its German customers a guarantee for fully equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Transportation Ministry last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirms that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting , and all the relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was meant in corporate circles .
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers , for example , to come into a workshop half a year after the retro@@ fitting , for example with a motor damage - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage does not have to do with it .
in customer interest , too , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the g@@ ass@@ le , there will be uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was said .
that is why VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ al interest from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
managing director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay pen@@ alties for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ al interest rate .
in September , Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund calls for this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits above 100,000 euros to sight deposit accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now , he has kept 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and that he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are located on the central bank account and cost 0.4 percent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lie down for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs are now further reduced .
leaving the cash in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank Chief .
most customers would have an understanding and changed to other investment forms .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing significant costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to bear you alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically un@@ sustainable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their bank account fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ s- und Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with penalty interest for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private customers to pay for deposits nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bank@@ ers said at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele whose wealth is more opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she &apos;s for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
established in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and business@@ men live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not currently known as banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and there is a threat to the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not like that in width .
destination boards : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before you rush to the comment section , to see it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non@@ Alle@@ e Men &apos;s Medi@@ ator Age with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement diver@@ ts from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millenni@@ als , who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record sal@@ es@@ men hold their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and stu@@ ffed wild before I stop , hold my hands and say something charming like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand close to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought were too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers he meets will meet on You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media shift , people who heard about the com@@ eback and encouraged themselves to buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to followers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like P@@ onica to see that record shops offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received a stimulus from the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from objects that awake happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessions of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own record players .
at this point in the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I plan@@ ed through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compilation .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came here just recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost an entire floor to the vinyl records , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - wild Be@@ asts newest synthes@@ izer and sex @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz comes from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but nag@@ ging psychological trauma is difficult to determine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds .

it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records ... &quot; she drives off with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am preten@@ ding to mu@@ ck jeans pants , I watch a group of young girls who are group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a cro@@ sley disk player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that has most for lux@@ uries such as plates .
even though my research yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they are not considered , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and turn@@ outs that exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .

French Court refuses offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
in a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses where persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , and which contain a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups judged the court that businesses and restaurants would be important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people carrying out the 72 provisional business , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture were &quot; absolutely track@@ able . &quot;
judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is operated in vain and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as counselling to asylum cases for the hundreds of un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a disaster that the youngest is eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants cher@@ ished that the number of people living in the jungle has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance in the Olympic season , Rad@@ pro Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get under way .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and continue fighting , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he does not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the Su@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s journey , &quot; said Martin .
he must analyze in peace the reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

group increases with start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people playing video games is huge - including Microsoft .
the technology group bu@@ ys the startup Be@@ am , which special@@ ises in this hobby .
Microsoft won &apos;t share the amount of money for the acquisition on Thursday .
with his offer , Be@@ am started the start in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give up players missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment .

here comes the Enfor@@ cement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed monitor : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new lightning devices will be tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , in areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to build bridges with temporary templates , there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is adher@@ ed to .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the Enfor@@ cement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days in un@@ interrupted measurement mode , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans at time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be moved according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in order that it is not simply cl@@ amped , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and , by the way , a cast @-@ resistant outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
also foreign authorities are flash@@ ing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units after an order of 150 pieces last year .
UK catches silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class returns gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in handling , side @-@ stit@@ ching , back @-@ up , line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad consol@@ ation price of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the obvious defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but no matter how Fi@@ ji in this form would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in top form .
it might be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have won a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan , they lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this key will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started out mira@@ culous and caused the attacks of G@@ Bs to boun@@ ce off fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell on and Co . as if one would run into running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au cleared in the corner .
with another four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB have hardly touched the ball .
a lively T@@ ack@@ le of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stops the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but Fi@@ ji has only stopped .
in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua drove a Touch@@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes what was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ i@@ ova ran through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a Touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ try , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ inging and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame sat the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced themselves and GB cr@@ ot@@ ched sm@@ ashed in the tur@@ f .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown killed the Bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ side team , secured the win - and therefore the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer to victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ ali@@ er than with these games and that &apos;s what you want .
from the first ru@@ dder angle up to the last , 220 hard si@@ eves who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when she ru@@ sted to the second Olympics in the branch without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , her 3@@ 9th uns@@ killed bet , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athletes gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph@@ al .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and there was no one more helpful than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day at all .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had a bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that was what they did .
if you do not , it will spread everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the break to a minimum if it is the right concept in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nerve breaking morning to talk more than anything else and thus tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was a Captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; This week I was an emotional wre@@ ck . this is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it repe@@ ats only how much I and Hel@@ en and I have worked as well .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or better coaching .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; remain in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago , it was called the original in a contribution by the Bavarian Broad@@ casting Company .
little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia acknowledged the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who has been in the ken@@ nel association for 31 years , is 28 years as Managing Director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner &apos;s mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed Wasser@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Pur@@ ch@@ asing Association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they were ranging from water management and maintenance work to office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency deployment at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , it called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new well ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the reconstruction of the high tank ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and new additions have always been added because water is the most important food in water and drinking water .
in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose band@@ age and he has literally lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe to reduce nit@@ rate in front of the water forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller also praised the water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ keeper and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights from his point of view .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the quar@@ ry at the elevated tank at Kirch@@ lager on a 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of new brunn can only be maintained because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who replaces Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots at risk of life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and mort@@ ally injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself inv@@ oked and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on his way to escape , and he is being punished publicly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , nationwide because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
in the meantime , the man has a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , such as the police .
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship at relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck didn &apos;t want to give any information about the conduct or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but she confirmed that a human being was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Light for@@ esi@@ ght for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Survey at existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economics Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption , to the cash desk .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a certificate with the EU Commission following talks with Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent is required .
but this too is not raised in the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ power generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the status quo of the previous provision is largely determined .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort has given special importance to the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of our campaign &apos; Steel is future &apos; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation further intensified as the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China threw huge steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers launch price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has relaxed a little .
on the one hand , the import duties imposed on import steel show effect ; on the other hand , economic prospects in China have risen .
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry is re@@ acting to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude any closures of individual plants .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than the previous year &apos;s figure , as the German Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a short rise in May , the quantity produced went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has fallen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
due to an improved order situation , the association expects an increased output in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing is good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit .
after all , singing from several perspectives is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kl@@ aters of the German Senior liga .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , senior citizens can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal occasion to spend time with other people .
this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from one another - a chor@@ us is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
because in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of trouble in everyday life as well .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of senior citizens .
in the older generations , common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that the singing or hearing of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ dementia patients are sin@@ king to long @-@ lying events .
when singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
to focus simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I become better and grow up beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advises .
one doesn &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears it when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , one can easily join in .
many cities also offer views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many sen@@ iors &quot; cho@@ irs can be found on the Internet as well .
those who have no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the internet research .
if you like to sing , you should definitely join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers at scre@@ am of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated the effect of k@@ itt@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys in adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ st@@ ew did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of exc@@ itation of k@@ itt@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the edge of the little ones .
they react at ten percent faster to the rate of k@@ itt@@ ens that are in great need , as scientists have found out at the Veter@@ inary School and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the writer of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous study , the team of researchers had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams differ with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency .
a total of nine adult males and eight female males from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H were observed .
they were played for a call by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted by scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
despite their low sample , the researchers consider their results conclu@@ sive .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said .
they turned out faster to the driver , when this calls were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already analysed the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans .
some studies showed that women were more sensitive to babies , no matter if they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ pf@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ n in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is held in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even at the suspension of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
in doing so , it is not possible to stop football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ pf@@ r .
according to this , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ pf@@ r should be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
it is true that the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact this has as good as no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at public places throughout the country declared to be ended on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the working club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at cup winners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially true on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acclaimed it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory finale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; will also leave early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it reached only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the year of the game was better for master Bes@@ ic@@ tas .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ protecting King .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
at the same time , following the coup attempt at AC Florence , following the coup attempt , the Gom@@ ez , which was borrow@@ ed from the AC , was announced after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in order to do this , the stor@@ mer would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about one @-@ third of its estimated annual salary , Or@@ man pointed out that &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have still med@@ als odds at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin had already been locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swimming teacher Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who compla@@ ined shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock@@ out , was ki@@ cked off without mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 metres chest ) .
it was a bizarre scene : with a smil@@ ed smile she was still gra@@ ced in the hall and provoked her appearance .
when it was clear that she would not get gold , the audience broke out in a storm of applause .
but there are a lot of other sports@@ men who are going to start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past .
here &apos;s an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its inc@@ eption , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to reti@@ re six months in 2010 after receiving the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had a strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion was tested positive for the banned Stim@@ ul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2012 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the know@@ ingly taking and was locked six months .
the four most far@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and has been locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible for eu@@ pon Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ head , Belarus ) : hardly an athlete was subsequently recognized as many med@@ als later .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after having found testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title because of testosterone deficiency .
the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games was also reg@@ ained due to a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and gold favorite was tested positive only in May but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications of taking a banned dietary supplement were found , the ban of World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran already on 13 July .
bom@@ b@@ terr@@ ors in Thailand - wounded in Austria - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
they have suffered cuts and have been treated in the hospital , but have already left them .
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the vac@@ ant island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , it is still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two war@@ heads went up again , according to the authorities another man was killed .
a bomb explosion was also reported from Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
during det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured according to police indications .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south east coast of the country then another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban cl@@ er@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explosive device went into the air in a flower bed before the coast@@ guard &apos;s prec@@ inct .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ eastern coast demanded several injuries .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ éri@@ av@@ ee Free day before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express himself to possible motives - but probably the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
in recent days , the authorities would have been receiving intelligence reports on imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
the police advised its officials throughout the country to reinforce the security surrounding important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the present bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( safety level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need to travel to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which took hold of power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ members itself to restore the kingdom again to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several countries , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also provided the group under observation .
&quot; at the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; we see evidence of efforts against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; said the German press agency , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate , the German press agency in Berlin .
thus migrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are har@@ med in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now watching the movement too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; already observe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that his authority was closely coordinated with the provincial authorities in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an in@@ descri@@ b@@ able advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda aims to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports on contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge . &quot; &quot;
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - changes its direction and becomes extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase of legitimate criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ose said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have found in recent years that there can be rights @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that further rights @-@ terrorism groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a German@@ ic @-@ wide or pan @-@ European control of legal terrorism cannot be seen .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ths expressed concern that many attacks went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right @-@ wing scene .
this is the cause of concern .
many of the suspect &apos;s suspect were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , which were perhaps politically in@@ different or voted for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always , the Olympic Games or World Records have the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s summer games .
in the Aqu@@ atics Centre the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ te then became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his previous race with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th position of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that drew attention from the international media .
why is the 24 year old participating in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ sheet from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ du@@ ed countries more well @-@ known .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ ub@@ les of whales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i ensured media attention .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a store in the New Place has been fo@@ aled .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday at 5 : 30 p.m. and forgotten to close a window on the ground floor .
when she came back the next morning at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier .
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp does not see the threatening electoral defeat so tight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tru@@ mp is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to be done with the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp already has an alternative video .
he then went on holiday .
if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party more and more resistance was formed .
mail enters into trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle from the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter too .
shortly , the Group plans to launch the trade with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer its electric vans on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been testing for months whether they will sell their self @-@ developed cluster sco@@ ot@@ ers , with which letters and pack@@ ets are to be sold to other companies .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always some questions about tra@@ des@@ people .
according to the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bon@@ ner Group plans to shortly enter the mass production of the vehicles .
in the post@@ war factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ d announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we are converting the whole fleet .

GF@@ K leadership decreases after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company replaces his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the company management , the global number five of the industry is facing a new start .
G@@ FR@@ P CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Ar@@ no Mahler Board of Directors is already reti@@ ring from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
as early as September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board took over the previous Executive Board , Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , and joined the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different opinions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details didn &apos;t want to call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will be leading the market research company in the future , is still unclear at the moment .
in investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were at least the disappointment about the continuing success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the latest bad Gf@@ K business figures , every investor will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company was unable to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
sales tot@@ aled € 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million in the first half of the year by 3.4 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earnings in the second quarter above all imp@@ acted the company &apos;s lower value in view of its difficult economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company value depreciation required in the Consumer Experience business area of EUR 139 million has secured the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into pit stop in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
in case of an accident of a coach with 43 elderly passengers as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ en@@ hear@@ n ( District Apostle Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to the indications , had to ev@@ ade a truck that was partially on the road .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a speaker told the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade was liberated by the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the scene of the accident on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the unexpected travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ erer district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter waste water take place from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World Group 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euros ( up to now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the waste water fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a high @-@ level calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when the household was approved by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was noted that there were under@@ cover for these waste water plants .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost @-@ effectively .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens , as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt presented to the Supervisory Board , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , sur@@ fac@@ ings and / or sub @-@ cover@@ ages of the preceding calculation period are to be observed .
the serious charges raised by Schmidt explained that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small , with a very low waste water waste , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining .
as a result of their age , refurb@@ ishment and repair costs continued to be a considerable part of all three plants , not least due to their age .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years old .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf because of damage .
in the world &apos;s pump plant , nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up . after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed , the slu@@ dge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; on these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , have been taken into account . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water waste in the three plants , expendi@@ tures for operation and maintenance were &quot; fully interrupted . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs , has remained spar@@ ed in the se@@ wer systems over the past 20 years .
the situation for the above mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious according to stone houses , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater treatment association will not be able to expand , because these facilities are defici@@ ent .
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that in July inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared with July 2015 .
in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods were observed compared to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
the prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices stayed as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .

Snap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some observers say it &apos;s in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure out of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are ir@@ res@@ isti@@ bly rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps are brought to the public .
in the past , Snap@@ chat Fil@@ ters have critici@@ zed critics in which they were accused of promoting the app black face fo@@ sters or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when a filter proposed to some users this week , who gave them mud @-@ eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics named it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; ja@@ un@@ dice . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced r@@ att@@ an@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others deci@@ ph@@ ered the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely spread that the filter was &quot; inj@@ uri@@ ous and gentle &quot; was unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very nasty Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ly @-@ faced , but that the yellow face has been dra@@ gged into the degra@@ ding extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tri@@ but@@ ary .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ chat &apos;s great audience of young people - who are more different to race di@@ vers@@ er than their older opponents - could rather expect to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ chat &apos;s filters creates an image that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much harder that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to er@@ ase her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on the media and in a telephone interview , she said that speed @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently hired a personnel officer focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military kidn@@ apping IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence intelligence to draw an optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on site , a report of the Congress was reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the comb@@ at@@ ant committees , secret service committees and military budget compromise , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence services typically enjoyed by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders posted a more positive picture of U.S. efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , stated .
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed illustrated problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic view of the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the congress were significantly more positive than it was the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ in could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to play the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the Republi@@ can Task Force conclusions .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments at IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest @-@ ranking member of the Board of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a position statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced mor@@ ale under analysts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated not to have found any clu@@ es about the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , who after complaints filed by Cent@@ com analysts .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alle@@ gations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the Cri@@ tique of the Secret Soci@@ eties of the Islamic State reminiscent of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush encountered only a small occupation force in Iraq and pre@@ tended to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker decl@@ aring that contrary to the statements of the government air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US won fourth match in the field of women &apos;s field , show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after hitting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she could not remember having ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a member of the people who keep their gates in memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which are unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will conver@@ ge on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place in their group from six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch a little longer out of the path that the other group will lead .
whatever the game on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey player in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years it became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ am said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not have the work place in London that we now have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have been able to take the helm out completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door row in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand from the close range .
India had gone into the tournament without winning the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
they performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the goal to give the American a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
immersed in the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro events feel steady and inevitable , a fast stag@@ gering between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the waiting line in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names that are sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tower .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , some in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognised : air gun shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and may reign for a long time .
but if I should mo@@ dest@@ ly make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
even though tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ously perceived that many who I had questioned did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline bed has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it matches the un@@ enlightened mind that sounds suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending swelling - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially uni@@ fies it .
the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means much like &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
up @-@ and @-@ coming riders jump on a giant trampoline , shoot at almost 30 feet in the air and have to shoot a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they end up on their feet .
according to official Olympic program , they are judged according to the design , difficulty and flight time .
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down at the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further high goal in tel@@ ev@@ ised transmission : that of the world or the Olympic bay .
the goal @-@ oriented striving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even touch a spect@@ ator with tears .
but it is also what I feel when watching these games as a bit ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly up again .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; most of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and the objectives of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan community .
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long one ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiop@@ ian just breaking together ?
over the past ten years , it has been one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into ever more territories .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was mer@@ cil@@ ess .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen were firing and killing dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos on the protests , which are presumably from the last or early of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Authority requires a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorist threats across the region , particularly in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was constra@@ ined , where dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or sent to prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and don &apos;t have any other options apart from prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Ze@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
following a far @-@ si@@ ghted election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea rise ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , disputed line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts feared that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the O@@ ga@@ den National Liberation Front , which were forced to force more or less in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and be able to arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness may explo@@ de after years of falling under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate via social media as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians concluded that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia and predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing right now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atus Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos feel that Ethiopia is largely dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population , dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Prime Minister until his death at an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years .
he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ le@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ le@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experiences such a rebellion was 2005 , after thousands protest against elections which , according to analysts , seemingly confused by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ra@@ ids that followed , many prot@@ esters were killed even though there were less than in the last few months and this time of tur@@ mo@@ il passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ art of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media .
analysts are saying that the protests of the US and other Western allies are in a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for flights to Somalia , even if it announced recently that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin congratulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his statement Obama had established IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raises new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings out his fellow campaig@@ ners who endea@@ vor to take protection during an event@@ ful period , to explain in the peculiar position , statements which he could not have meant .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp cancelled the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tru@@ mp told in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Tru@@ mp while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter he warned that Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he strongly critic@@ ised himself when he thought that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are accepted by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an even more et@@ ched note , as its poll@@ s continued to decline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp in general tries not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp most prominent speakers , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back @-@ banks , completely false , and that &apos;s why it happened because he withdraw@@ s troops from Iraq .
most mainstream public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread herself by being aggressive under control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on every one of his words and against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s excuse as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ gy cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only bar , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were sup@@ planted .
the business So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , who replaced Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people rap@@ ed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , it &apos;s also new invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized club café opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time collabor@@ ator of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural White Bow@@ ls .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just one Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the club closed , she gave up the coffee ham for a while , she said .
&quot; it became clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club I liked , &quot; she said .
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee that is another new addition .
since the beginning of the club in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long@@ time and faithful customer .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day like a Swiss watch @-@ watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual place , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business had taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for use with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new client has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice store wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb goes out to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after its ascent to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch in the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land .
his menu on that day was a little more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pu@@ ree and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was inspired by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard . &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ zzy snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the re@@ porter ordered Hack@@ ett , the couple found appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ uts , liver and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinners .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; records the ways that the country avoided being no longer the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central theme for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Co@@ e why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat that was the center of American cuisine for years became a rare luxury .
peculiar mixtures were tried out , as a low @-@ calorie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular supplement for lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
as never before or ever since , budget@@ ary econom@@ ists - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have influenced the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he fed like the million@@ aire man of the world to which he became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the complain@@ ant of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors created by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man remembered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
after the dishes were cleared by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e drew up a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a real trick to miss a modest name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone showed a little reluct@@ antly one spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
surprisingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E picked up three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ ge@@ cutter he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some hack@@ ed Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives to others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a group of civil defence groups who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved the lives of nearly 6@@ 0.000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives in the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the Civil Guard , showing him in an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes he never saw himself , said the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself attacked an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland shar@@ k usually only comes to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland shar@@ k has only 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average straight 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed it is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle , dominated by slow@@ ness , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the trade journal &quot; Science &quot; from a Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , which represents a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland shar@@ k became st@@ ony .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius , they usually occur only in winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland shar@@ k .
their time @-@ slow pent@@ ec@@ es were measured by them when they exter@@ min@@ ated six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , this sh@@ arks make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ aver , that tor@@ ped@@ o from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland shar@@ k , the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest proportion was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
in order to determine the age of the animals , the carbon @-@ 14 method analyzed the nucle@@ us of sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably plenty of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons experiments cast large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res of length , the l@@ enti@@ l , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapons tests , which is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland shar@@ k , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their core , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k would be even 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland shar@@ k with the increase obviously leave at least one and a half centuries time .
this is probably the world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such meth@@ us@@ ages live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bacon on the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon point , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
so they ri@@ pen later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal for@@ fei@@ ts heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should , on the contrary , invest its resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
the council at the latest meeting focuss@@ ed on topics relating to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee accepted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently shown flats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the land , plot and access issues were clari@@ fied and applications for surve@@ ying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential construction areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße area - part 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau attract young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , building volunteers can now announce themselves in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to discuss the awar@@ ding of the plots in its September meeting .
in order to be able to meet requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises , linked to the creation of jobs , the council decided to change the land use plan which was newly created in spring this year .
in the area of Unter@@ new@@ lar@@ n , the already designated commercial area is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of Main , therefore , has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Market of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether financial institutions can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport they have been granted approval in the UK .
that &apos;s why big US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced that they will shift jobs .
the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , though , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg has a large fund sector , but as well as Dublin does worse in infrastructure .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
furthermore , the city points to easily available space properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in number 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the balance of forces also speaks for this : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US official judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ ad@@ i of Gilead stood after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the law@@ suit was collected on Thursday , U.S. Ambassador Beth@@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead was entitled to reli@@ ance on costs arising during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck embra@@ ced each other and took possession of laboratories where sof@@ os@@ bu@@ clo@@ vir became underlying , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday said .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb@@ ats after the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ on Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council of Reu@@ ters , al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are just carrying out cleaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earning 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and paying 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday that resulted in USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary of State Bill Clinton reported an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on its term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Sen@@ ator Tim K@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations of the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri announced in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and withdraw@@ als regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not oblig@@ ated to do so by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for ref@@ using to withdraw .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the democr@@ ats &quot; presidential candidate .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp specialist advis@@ er , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to release something before the tax inspections were not completed .
rum@@ or critics , among others the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lic@@ ans invite Tru@@ mp to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she addressed the subject also during a speech on the business in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO announced that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp did not pay for two years or very little tax , and a business journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax advis@@ ors and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tru@@ mp to meet at a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to an I@@ RS tax check and Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released a tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons that now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that they received USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main financial investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders .
the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , intensified its promotion together with the U.S. nature conservation , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the international telephone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants out of their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include lighting of the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
together with a fire@@ work body , the powder mixed with soil is packed into a con@@ dom , the end of which is turned to the ignition coil .
when lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spark@@ s fine dust at ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders in the air .
a hint is usually enough to chase the elephant .
one last option is a laun@@ cher that shoots a gil@@ ded fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , light explosion .
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no new ki@@ osk construction at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects by commercial operators with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and are taking place - but the retail trade in the core city is currently considered to be clearly exp@@ and@@ able .
the City Council , however , now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the construction of a sales ski@@ bus on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine bal@@ kon@@ s currently under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , we welcome new business owners , but this ki@@ osk does not fit in this location on the Rhine shores , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath to the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director deca@@ ys Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; sum@@ mons - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin didn &apos;t list any Israeli pre @-@ election as it would have asked Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the local country selection list .
the country , however , was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call centre .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attracted him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be cleared , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and were troubled .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet where people called it a sc@@ andal .
some of them subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to the supposed aff@@ or@@ estation of Arabian guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article in which the hotel , located on the clas@@ sy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly dismissed all alle@@ gations and called the incident an &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; to put Israel into the Quick List , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting bra@@ zi@@ lian students
students met with the police in Sa@@ o Paulo , Brazil on Thursday when they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to use rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on their plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest participants saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets in crowds to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran rises suddenly to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ y@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent year @-@ on @-@ year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian businesses increased greatly in businesses in the country , the ambassador with .
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the major priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ y@@ gar@@ yan .
he noted that trading revenues between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports into Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boost was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ y@@ gar@@ yan continues this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representation gave approximately 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : beverage market inv@@ aded in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y event has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ inated their faces demanded the issuing of cash from the staff of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured does not tell the police .
the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters large , so relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible from the top of the re@@ we market and is difficult to see .
after the raid on Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and the gravel parking lot located opposite the car park , the perpetr@@ ators must be fled by car with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) must urgently notify the police in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun at summer
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the Social Pe@@ dago@@ gical Day / Social group work of the child protection group Nag@@ old with their car@@ egi@@ vers during their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet leisure district of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to b@@ ail with the visit of the pet@@ rel zoo .
on the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion took place in Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the Deep Sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and planning .
children and car@@ egi@@ vers with their self prepared body@@ work such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were a culinary delight .
in workshops it was b@@ ati@@ ked , creating beautiful jewels made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot;
on the day of departure , the sun and the children and young people returned home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , St. Anna , travelled to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were dealt with together .
in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ pu@@ y journey of all mini@@ regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the St. Anna senior minister has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various shr@@ ines have been tested and one finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the open gate of mercy on Freiburg &apos;s Cathedral .
16 And Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and H@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the hal@@ lowed rooms , went their way .
in the evening before , Fr . stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony at St. Anna , blessed the Cru@@ ci@@ fixi@@ on and distributed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b , by train to the start point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster de@@ ar@@ est Lady stands , and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , depending on a brief impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is made rush to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgri@@ m song booklet .
the parish offices of the local parish were available for the overnight stays .
at the stage meetings Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller were responsible for a tasty and tonic dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
on top of that , the trip to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , had to be lowered and climbed up to 500 metres when the heat was full .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Bad@@ hus@@ pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter the final stage went to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the later afternoon and went through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was thank@@ ed here .
in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is received by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were greeted by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms at home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner was the last evening in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roll , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself . the yo@@ ke made the legend hau@@ ghty when he stor@@ med home to capture a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place at the World Championships in London in March , despite the resignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a sign .
Ho@@ ys retired created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won the race four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner won a match in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was almost back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation when going down in a higher gear to slow it down and make it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as the BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally struck by the track .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a superb victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB of flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to get back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form Kenn@@ y it is in the field of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were also born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next to the Sprint , which will start today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , with a focus on W@@ ig@@ gins .
he had argued yesterday with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura hasn &apos;t advanced , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of med@@ als .
following a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
dra@@ mas took place in the background , so the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton technical director in April was in the middle of sex@@ ism and bul@@ lying repro@@ aches as well as reti@@ ring sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but when one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the now legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land based on the abolition of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium melt of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect , as the melting mill consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victoria .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AG@@ L also stated that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point on , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the income in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier of electricity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it has already written down the value of the contracts in its annual subscription in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expectation of cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the contracts , the &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt @-@ melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt @-@ cutting &quot; does not interfere .
the US company said that in 2010 it signed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation of why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt @-@ mill in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the statements by the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity each year .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the seventh issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan , is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sep@@ tem@@ ber@@ rint of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and running on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced on Thursday news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , sc@@ aled reality video showing the whole Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the universally popular show bi@@ z uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classical twist : they all have a surprise party planned .
this is the c@@ lich@@ é@@ d plot of almost every episode episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon rabbit on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of das@@ hi@@ ans has begun with security .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim might have struck her as far as Vo@@ gue covers ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is for Vo@@ gue the most popular edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , which rather resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Ac@@ cords Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years the magazine &apos;s pictures still leak before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , model@@ ed &quot; as models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are on the cover .
Oscar @-@ pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if all is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers likes success not everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always a bit ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised them and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ ins of the moment . &quot;
these feelings turned up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall @-@ apps .
she sells pictures of her daughter C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the LOVE magazine .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
there are 16@@ 0.000 people per year from congreg@@ ational centres .
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid needs are rejected annually by the municipal asylum centers , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mean cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which have already been fully util@@ ised , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , it is expected that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l community centre said that the last survey of the National Union of Common Law Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were already rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would be even worse without an ann@@ ul@@ ment of the decision by the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said .
people who rely on violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
the Federal Government will shor@@ ten the funding by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of people in need of assistance will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Justice Minister , as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customers and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp was indic@@ ted after having allegedly arms
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign was prosec@@ uted for alleged in@@ action after telling her that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a gun on a staff in February , while she was on the road in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment submitted to Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software progra@@ mmer for the campaign in this state .
B@@ ord@@ i announced for months that the matter would be regulated internally before it realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right index finger at the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the barrel in Vincent &apos;s knee , &quot; gave B@@ ord@@ i in his indictment .
after compla@@ ining in the local and regional campaign management , he stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can candidate cast a uph@@ eav@@ al when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms and arms bud@@ dies - should take action if his rival was elected H@@ illary Clinton and should appoint Ju@@ dge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mps Camp@@ a@@ ign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ alt@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and of Philip for bodily harm and lasting psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mps press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to reach an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer members of the campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) considerable losses are notable for the government parties of the SPD and the CD@@ U .
this resulted in representative surveys conducted by the IN@@ SA opinion research institute for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely rule in the North , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD over@@ threw 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent from five years to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only paraly@@ zed the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the Left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( 18.@@ 4 percent previously ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite the slight losses of 6 per cent ( previous 8.@@ 7 per cent ) , the Gre@@ ens returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
according to the survey , the SPD of the survey will only come to 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still lying behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previous 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 per cent for the first time in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9@@ ,000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator entered the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the tool weighed almost half a kilogra@@ m and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ unk@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
the &quot; Nokia 9@@ 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , fans can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Inter@@ Net age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it trade fair in Hanover , Germany , as an &quot; West liner office . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was accessible .
even accessing web pages was possible via HTML browsers , though tor@@ mented slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was pretty proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could imagine in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; cell phone segment experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , the market is dominated by providers who all came a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is a daily routine for many people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world .
about 1.4 billion units sold , Samsung and Apple account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the t@@ elec@@ om companies .
meanwhile a whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple CEO Steve Jobs did the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all by touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march was still the most important product of the Group today .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors such as Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get rid of the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips alone , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ bed on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ishers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 bn in com@@ ical growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the whole GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who has implemented a £ 11 billion investment package in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row from the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Game &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software vendors trying to b@@ ypass advertising blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; is the same .
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blo@@ gging on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it told users to update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared with the fact that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements in order to complic@@ ate recognition of the recognition of which part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams , spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth battle has been underway since the invention of display blo@@ wers &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how high concern indicators have become for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertis@@ ers &apos; revenue .
the company has ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social networking and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs is a huge amount of revenue , making Facebook the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared with the fact that it would update its &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be worried about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we have instead concentrated on Develop@@ ers tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss Autobahn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night .
the police witnesses that after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident promp@@ ts them to report .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings after she killed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , took the court .
the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who responded to an emergency call -- in a justified way , drove and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; perfectly exceptional and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhabited
the Venus was probably inhabited once according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once could have rejected similar conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and protect against faster evap@@ oration .
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus highlights its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain producing a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution that was previously thought by planet scientists .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans are evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our bla@@ sted away from the ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen with@@ stood only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect , the Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy back as coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy back as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday , contributing to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively @-@ President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position statement .
during the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had been recru@@ ited by Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Patrick has informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season , Roy has won the 2013 @-@ 14 A@@ val@@ an@@ ches as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best trainer of the League .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches featured a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short of five points behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ o@@ emen pick up talks again , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles on compensation for the North Sea workers are suspended , while all parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some day @-@ to @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , starting next year to tackle the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ parties in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has fired thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its operations as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG .
energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British ruling in June to leave the European Union .
at the beginning of this week , the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to average around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star @-@ pile rotate to different rates as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods with planetary formation are standing .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star hotels , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , said in a press release .
the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mat@@ uring stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnet @-@ fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less solid stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turn more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull commented .
as the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull commented .
there is much ahead of us about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports extensively about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional resignation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been given to him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as consultant and youth coach in the future - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two more bas@@ eball players are showing similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the ball@@ room of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was on the field , so controversial his appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted to have forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was locked for 2@@ 11 games on the basis of an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received performance @-@ promoting funds over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for many years .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could have done even a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell @-@ days also do not run quietly .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games played the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received the sympathy of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e &apos;s arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympics 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a learned athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swimming teacher Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metre obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski , were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions this news came to an end .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was proven to be used as a mas@@ king drug for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the events more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
during the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing have been requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association assumes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Criminal Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is not the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also at the night of Rio the news of the positive trial of Dan@@ ek@@ ova filtered through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it should act with the banned substance of the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ specimen should already have a positive effect .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported his criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier than his brother Tom@@ as@@ z .
both deny the intake , however , both should not start in the class up to 94 kil@@ os .
before starting the athletes , especially the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for the exception of systematic dop@@ ing , and the country of Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming sport , the earlier contracts in China had also caused violent clas@@ hes between the athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also was the focus of an engagement with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been tested positively by the Chinese champi@@ ons in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ aci@@ din , but had to leave only a three @-@ month lock .
data lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ ma@@ ges hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail servers are currently targeting enterprises - and they are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey by the malware Ab@@ wehr specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies were at least once in the past twelve months , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies already had the goal of ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the money required by the perpetr@@ ators to re @-@ use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetr@@ ators clearly speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential for ex@@ tor@@ tion money is considerably higher than in private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertisements .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks resulted in a frigh@@ tening pace over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or Database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delete the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ press .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users have the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stagn@@ ates .
accordingly , the damage is higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 per cent of Germany &apos;s affected companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to stop business operations completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acute by the loss of acute attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the call of the perpetr@@ ators in view of stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the Safety Res@@ ear@@ chers of F @-@ Secure examined the user interfaces and the contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ figure sums to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more professional and sharing their jobs , says security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware @-@ kits have been created by providing malware , advice , and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers then search for more hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set by a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is done per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the company &apos;s IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on the ability to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful performance , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means that the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in future , the perpetr@@ ators could have completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat associated with the internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , such a block@@ aded heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda will pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear .
the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit upper side is a little bit off .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a boot space of 4@@ 53 l for raised back@@ rests , but there are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema seat and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment is well loaded , but the height of the cargo is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide re@@ v areas .
however , he should do his work a bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( operates at speeds of 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he points out many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light wi@@ zard works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles speed on demand .
but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and an HDMI bush are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : fall on air passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only for dangers typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of living , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay any compensation for the man .
case of disease : when paid by the organizer
after their trip , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back if the cause of the disease is without doubt in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vomiting on the second day of their pri@@ mor@@ dial ger@@ mination .
she spent almost all the vacation in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective water treatment plant , which allegedly polluted the sea@@ water .
the family was of the opinion that the trip had been lacking - and compla@@ ined against the promot@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was al@@ right .
he has therefore not viol@@ ated his information obligations , thus the judgment .
no contamination was found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly through con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the common risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violent acts committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state must react calm@@ ly and decisi@@ vely at the same time react to terror threats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and divisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to terrorists .
if convic@@ ts have to leave the country more quickly , this will increase the security and strength of the population for refugee policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère seeks to implement the proposals to the 2017 Bundestag election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be under penalty .
video surveillance should be improved , am@@ ended the right to am@@ end weapons , making it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet .
the most recently discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions , how the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of mental ab@@ norm@@ alities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to counter@@ act a ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a b@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
he does not consider a general prohibition of full @-@ veil to be constitutional .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d anything you re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about traffic or witnesses in court .
the Green Party leader Sim@@ one Peter repro@@ ached the minister that he wanted to simulate crime and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist acts .
left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right to stay do not bring people in this country any more security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the highway feeder
it is st@@ owed on a regular b@@ ypass - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is to change : the law reform should be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are driving in traffic every evening in traffic jams if they drive over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction will extend the right @-@ hand lane by 700 meters in the area between Hammer Straße and the Wes@@ er Straße .
drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Straße to the right .
the big advantage : traffic spl@@ its early , thus improving the overall procedure on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district representing Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder is especially annoying between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ pit extends up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h Way and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , the traffic is diver@@ ted via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back in a good three @-@ four@@ ths of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge would no longer possess the required load capacity to record heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the inter@@ mitt@@ ent daily traffic jam will continue , the responsible regional operation cannot be said .
however , it must be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official rest period up to 20@@ 34 .
in order to extend the law of law , the country has deliberately chosen the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays , as it can be expected with disabilities .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Tourism : culture offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students visited the production in the Small House between eleven and 15 years .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the young people of the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Young Theatre Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ ys , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in theatre play and theatrical distribution are in the planning stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association reck@@ ons with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has caused the shooting of stars in south @-@ west Germany on the night to Friday , but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the sky &apos;s spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are among the quick@@ est shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning is far ahead of the wake @-@ up bells no longer think of sleep .
this is anything but restor@@ ative .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adult sleeping disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep is frequent or permanent as not restor@@ ative .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes for them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ Chat , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Medicine and S@@ leep Medicine .
what one understands for the time being , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , thus a single and sleeping disorder .
many people consider staying asleep as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board member of the German house doctor association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al @-@ related factors , but also drugs .
not in@@ frequently , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ alth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are mutually dependent .
those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , for example , can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and start thinking about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I consult your doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , advises Wa@@ iting .
the impairment can look quite different : you are beaten , tired , ind@@ eli@@ ble , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like ga@@ stri@@ c or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic slaugh@@ tering tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly any medical practitioner in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
therefore , when sleeping problems should be directed to the primary doctor , she advises to eat too .
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise , for example , with snor@@ ing with breathing holes , in case of disease @-@ related fatigue , for sleeping @-@ conver@@ ters , or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only do not take a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ acking , you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ mask , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera draws on the ceiling of the sleeping @-@ ends .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few screws on which you can set up for a better sleep .
what matters is that regular sleeping and up@@ setting , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleeping , avoid alcohol and not watch the clock in the night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing tail@@ oring of the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 , he first took Gold at the short @-@ track world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V athlete Markus Dei@@ bler via Facebook put himself in front of his ex te@@ amm@@ ate in front of his criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle of € 150@@ ,000 no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night .
the conveyor system in swimming sport is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
with this we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that is exactly how it should be kept with countries .

airport : ties of baggage claim arrested
professional thi@@ eves at the airport Düsseldorf
the police of the Düsseldorf Police took the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years on Thursday .
as a gang , the susp@@ ects committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage pil@@ es .
at 21.@@ 30 pm , civil servants in the Düsseldorf airport picked up a band that was known to the polic@@ emen from past anti @-@ theft deli@@ ght@@ ings .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July of this year and were very professional , work@@ able and very professional .
the specialists of the Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department 34 have been able to demonstrate four acts to the Di@@ eben , who had specifically travelled to Germany to commit crimes .
in the process , they had exploited more than 15,000 Euros in total .
old buildings , some lin@@ den baths , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like this , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from the east to the west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
someone &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; has spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house .
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 .
article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , in recent weeks , however , is favor@@ ed by burning cars .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , now the inhabitants have rent contracts , but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin sen@@ ator Henkel had spoken multiple times for a hard action of the police against the project , called the area as a &quot; No @-@ Go zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after three weeks of official statements were cleared on the ground floor , the cad@@ re @-@ smi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team @-@ cars on @-@ site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers removed from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain in front of late i .
a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has brought up three children , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted more police protection against the v@@ and@@ alizing left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin @-@ based sen@@ ator and the police open between home occup@@ ants and their neighbors , obviously does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and high poverty risk .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer road close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was swept under large police forces in a real street fight , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and ball@@ ads from all over the world in recent years : with them , residents of the G@@ DR times and former home occup@@ iers are sharing their neighbourhood .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on raised discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that have been filled with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lin@@ ked Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are causing damage , which tends to make new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived for 17 years in a ten@@ ant house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
in terms of violence , it is important : people in 94 are their neighbors , they were not meant to be .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er any longer .
for the architect , the street is not a criminal off@@ ence , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously dra@@ gged into the Riga road - and has remained .
that &apos;s why it was so important for them that the residents get their streets back : from the police , politics and the media , who in July all suddenly claimed the distinc@@ tiveness of the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building houses , which the old residents disp@@ lace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is , in the end , con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for those who like colour bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the lef@@ tist scene belonged to the neighbourhood .
those who draw , should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub , can complain about noise there .
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be called with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for the integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on the spot .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Agency for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact partner for all stakeholders : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else interfer@@ es .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ghty Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem above all .
for example , some - less sne@@ e@@ zing on the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative manager with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an experienced Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full time players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be available in the washing line
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
you have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these lod@@ gings must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the board of directors to the commun@@ e and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not work , unless one relies on private dwell@@ ings , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be soli@@ di@@ fied , as it is so beautiful .
new containers will soon be placed in the washing line .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent lead , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be gro@@ unded or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for community will result in a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but work does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
this means that administration and honorary officials jump here as well .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever develops the feeling at some point will not help anyone in Ur@@ bach but should not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority was motivated .
the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and his customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer clearly says , &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them .
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have the fear that the kill@@ ers put them in complete retri@@ bution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region .
in doing so , they always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid .
actually , it is unfair to spot them on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate previous people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated there are no simple answers .
