<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a little change with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remember their holiday, they hunted home in the fast gallop home.</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He sat down with his family about the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even go for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the framework of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, silver laurel leaf, champion-tour-player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already filled it up.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "" "" "Langer says," "" "" "" "she is also awarded for social commitment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting young talents.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of EUR 25,000.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The recorded include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the former Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the drummer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the legendary rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumous of the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of those sporting legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two US presidential competitors, however, are unone in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental principle.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The one on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt small and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he will retire from regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Clinton, on the other hand, says:" "" "" "" "the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities for disadvantaged and needs money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, it says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "invest in that must be invested," "" "" "" "says Trump and Clinton." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the democratic candidate is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the government-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Trump, however, internal discussions could still be made.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump plans to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate agreement will be announced.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to extend and demand renewables with its investment programme:" "" "" "" "a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign them.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid even better, for example Clinton asks.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes and its critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance doctors called on their union to approve new work combat activities in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work combat activities from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that ministers had agreed to deal with concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in favour of the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members released on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "calm" to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "" "" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "" "" "?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile appeared narrow-lipped and he barely radiated heat, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something terrible happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downfall of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin stripped and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the cousins again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks had to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed that vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was relieved of his office last month in a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually take several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are based on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this week the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "a report in Vedemosti put it as follows:" "" "" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West as it considers the reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for this, the continued grudge of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state gained a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, as an analyst once described, to present an "alliance of outsiders."</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently given itself the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents expressed at the press conference that they hadn't even touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to stress it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the global ambitions of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank has distanced itself since it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-consumer brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it has decided to focus on more national brands.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank trademark is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other smaller brands for the retail business that are more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He divided Scotland with: "the brand RSB becomes our investor's brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy as we now become more of a bank of brands."</seg>

<seg id="4">He put a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reached the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>

<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derbysieger had 4,493 career paths</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of Modernism and it's no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have achieved before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma delight fans for years for this kind of sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergej Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of the narrowest confidence circle of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed special Commissioner for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a statement by the Kremlin, it is said that without giving reasons," "" "" "" "the resignation of Ivanovs has been ordered by his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been the proxy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it is said (in Russian) that he was later Chief of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state on bills of bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin announced to the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked for leaving his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has taken Moscow into a mysterious place.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once touted as a potential president to initiate the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining about four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin, former member of the Security Service, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, as a third term of office would have violated the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bevel ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project, which is worth £1.35 billion, is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Queensland crossings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fitting.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the entire deck deck is in its place and the last section of the deck now gets a gong for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor said: "the first closure is a significant milestone for every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project is the closure of future-oriented high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the existing northern tower, we had to close the gap on the north or the landing page.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD will propose a "Action Plan Home" at the next council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">Up to now, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "" "" "in the future, those who want to build on urban areas must reject 20 percent of all homes as social housing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="16">No matter how viola, there is a sharpening of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="21">How do you compare the loss of other around 1300 apartments, whose promotion will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, now pending ties from the city should be purchased.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to bring back homes back into the price relationship.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of the year, the western city dates back to the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="29">Only: this is not what the owners want, the housing companies do not want.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because if the number of social housing in the western city is increased drastically, it is removed from the goal of the so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged people in just a few districts.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "" "" "said Group president Holger Herlitschke:" "" "" "" "the CDU must be in a boat for a broad majority." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, was lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it is great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created first for video games in the 1990s (later a series of animation, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell slightly at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon which are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, "photographed" (over a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the runway and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to "take 30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "be active everyday" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people looking miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close up new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also grumpy game spoillovers who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit have already been able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade away with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokéons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help many people in hunting to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast blossomed on Thursday for the championship title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American Women Simone Biles turnt on the balance beam during the individual competition for women at the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilhah is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins majority and the fifth, while consolidates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey took an end at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Bila has dominated the last three years her sport, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Reson told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was awaiting her last examination in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American Women Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual competition for women at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="21">Although Billie insisted, during their long journey to the top, never planned the future, that's not really true.</seg>

<seg id="23">That is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, in which Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since summer 2013, it has not lost any competition competition, a winning series that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although Mustafina was slightly guided by two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish Knives and Danes - in which Bilesh holds the world title - watched.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and put one on top with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her final bail - a pure formality - and tears streaming on Biles glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision that she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team of men, called "Oma," by the Americans, has a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their downfall, she cast down kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Bilesh, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in one of the deadliest attacks in Phoenix when they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots out of a handfirearm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police informed that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of robbery, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that belonged to one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in hispanic residential areas within four months and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it happens in a residential area in front of a house," "" "" "" "shared Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report about the shootings which had been sampled on an empty pickup truck half an hour before the threefold murder and that it was the work of serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympionship in the gymnast and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I joined every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison's Kocian, which is Catholics, rounds off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise winner of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they provided unexpected but masterly gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't see turntables in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympics will only have four gymnasts in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily in private gymnastic clubs which are maintained by parents for training, training, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both of her athletes ever since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to provide the municipalities with countless young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-access gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high quality gymnastic, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of "Girl Power" by bringing the Olympic team gold and thanks, you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers were hoping to terminate the dispute over the changes caused by the adoption of a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance doctors voted for a vote rejected it.</seg>

<seg id="4">The first assistance doctors will receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend dates in order to improve the care at diastal times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Committee for Assisted Doctors, announced last night in a message: "assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it is going to heat up the current occupation crisis and treat it to all doctors."</seg>

<seg id="3">Anticoagulant medication Ticerelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the artery walls that form plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot causing the flow of blood to the heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the flow of blood and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who have had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name of Brilique reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticalrelor, followed by 60mg twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Evaluation Centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticalrelor is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes among people who have had a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former member of the cabinet, Sir Eric Pickles, verbally attacks the police, election observers and town councils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government, now an antagonist king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off tapes outside of electoral districts to protect intimidated voters.</seg>

<seg id="7">At the moment a voter just has to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes that non-removable ink should apply to a person's finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone from selecting twice.</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the reigning mayor Luton Rahman should be removed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which a person chooses someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed particular interest in the fraudulent choice of letters, in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system including the leadership of ID cards to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, it is stated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exerted, especially women and young people, in order to vote according to the will of elders, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video by Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you're approaching from the front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "if you get closer to you from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and" "" "" "" "go out of the firing line," "" "" "" "says Mizrachi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with the knee in the groin and rotate, while the attacker collides with pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while they direct the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent a serious examination by detecting some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and traveller Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a toilet button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prior to the lick of each object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will let himself be.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of stopping the rinsing button of a toilet which has already been used by thousands of others may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left him, which he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to railway stations to washing-up knobs of toilets, the task put his immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was justified in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample line showed a luminometric number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after their luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial count at different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended saying that we said" "" "" "" "Let's call Ian." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he would lick some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others, with whom this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing supplements containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asoziale family left their social housing after a delogiation with a loss of £50,000, because they terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had perforated holes, wooden planks were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been moved around and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live this way." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror inflicted by the family, street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and floods came.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, testified that it would have had the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>

<seg id="26">Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">He added, "It is a shame that the tenant had agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delogiation is always the final step considering Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was said to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special observation after numerous doping contracts at the IOC for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by the IOC before the Rio Olympics, it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency held a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a consequence, the WADA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the rules of the WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is regarded as a great runner nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of TV reports of the ARD, accusations have been raised again and again that doping drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports betting.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">In doing so, it was possible to prove that in this sport area was widespread and systematic.</seg>
<seg id="26">As a result, Russia's athletes were excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="1">The "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With this a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," the funnel Bernsteins Hauptwerk.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director of Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled her with the role of Mary as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="6">The orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Symphony under the leadership of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we have Bernstein's music really in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Maria is playing and dancing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First because it is musically exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it is clever, of course also naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"she is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as Roman," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honour for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormous human being.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "and Bartoli returns the compliment:" "" "" "" "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">For him, conducting is a necessity.</seg>
<seg id="24">One sees it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highly topical: "this piece deals with prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puvercans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are the same topics and they are as meaningful as ever.</seg>
<seg id="30">59 years later, the piece is still relevant.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign fight - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">They have understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the Sunday election will not be held right at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament decided already at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because more stupid than previously it's not possible: summer holidays, heat and land baldness struggle - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so do not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays helpers, posters hang up, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count voices in the end.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and the last holiday days, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let the election campaign run over itself almost by the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party ever since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalitionable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one sees from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary word-called predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Apart from that, Seering got cold feet and chancellor Angela has the blame for the blooming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "their refugee policy, their" "" "" "" "We create this" "" "" "" "accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaign at the right time at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Angela Merkel twice as Chancellor Angela Merkel to large demonstrations; Merkel's electoral district is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania recently complained in the NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a pity not to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Nordost-CDU renounces the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "that, so means Kokert, plays only a" "" "" "" "subordinate role" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has noticed that you crumble the base on the land, that it has to be very hard to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">Like the Left, the SPD, the Greens, you hardly exist in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU-elector Kokert to his co-workers is also self-exposing: "they have to go where it hurts, namely, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the social democrats last 22 per cent behind partner CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD won a clear 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Green Party, with seven percent in the polls, is likely to make the leap into the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of their holiday necessity and largely relocate their election campaign to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "online election campaign" "" "" "", "it calls the national presidents Claudia Müller." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Apart from that, green election fighters embark on searching for domestic vocal chords among the holidaymakers.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 rehabilitation: restaurants suffering from closure</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for construction, starting at 5.30 in the morning and ending at about 8pm, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty well," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is also commended to the mutual benefit of those responsible for the construction work, for instance when it comes to the establishment of expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasion through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there were some serious complaints," "" "" "" "says Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachmann Street, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping routes were looking for and more familiar to their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas franke.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not adhered to, the municipality increasingly called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there were significant overrifts," "" "" "" "says King, who himself was able to inform himself about the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">There have already been two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that the street is now open for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to breakthroughs in these countries makes everyone who wonders to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are produced for other companies, for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "also at the dealership, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "" "" "" "slight drop" "" "" "", "but also acknowledges that" "" "" "" "the running documents are missing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most shaken are the local restaurants along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "not only it, but all the restaurants I met" "" "" "" "hard hit." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were lacking.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to be happy about every Euro turnover." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "he estimates the sales revenue for" "" "" "" "more than 50 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "road marking had its operation" "" "" "" "thrown back" "" "" "" "by two years" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the advice given, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much more funding has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">For all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regular guests are less frequently visited because of the complicated traffic flow.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot come here, it is also very nice elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele comes back to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>

<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising either." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière is starting a second approach for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and jihadists with dual citizenship boning the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "" "" "the CDU man admits." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still believes this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance with the coalitionist anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by de Maizière as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">They sometimes have it in themselves: he is planning quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees that are targeted into the country should check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of Duldings for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as commit crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally sanctioned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some still seem unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the perpetrators of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, given the high number of refugees, many people were worried about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people were deeply involved let themselves not be clinging out even during election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is hugely put into focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are elections.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly turning their attention to internal security issues.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, the two parties went up high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garnish conflict about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security-political ideas-collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the resort leaders also demand a burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship.</seg>

<seg id="11">According to the sales manager Jürgen Stackmann, the weaker figures from July were mainly due to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhaust-type was first escalated, another minus is also to be found.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected family brand of Lower Saxony is already lightly damaged by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months there is only one delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had tampered with a software exhaust gas testing.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars for retrofitting into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After upgrading the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.</seg>
<seg id="23">After retrofitting, the car manufacturer issued a "guaranteed" certificate, but I do not speak of a "guarantee" as it was called in business circles on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is juridical intricacies.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Focus" "" "" "" "reported that Volkswagen now offers its German customers a guarantee for fully equipped diesel models." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "deviations from this are not accepted," "" "" "" "said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to ministry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has assumed that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after retrofitting, and all the relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" but not as it was meant in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "warranty" Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers, for example, to come into a workshop half a year after the retrofitting, for example with a motor damage - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage does not have to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">In customer interest, too, it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the gassle, there will be uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was said.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is why VW does not use the term "warranty."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination boards: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section, to see it under the pseudonym NonAllee Men's Mediator Age with harsh insults, this statement diverts from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record salesmen hold their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stuffed wild before I stop, hold my hands and say something charming like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent salesmen were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand close to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70" "" "" "" "when I was 11 or 12. things I thought were too young to buy them," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers he meets will meet on YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media shift, people who heard about the comeback and encouraged themselves to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ponica to see that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers received a stimulus from the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from objects that awake happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessions of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record do not own record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I planed through a pile of Bossa nova compilation.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here just recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-specific, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people saying:" "" "" "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the vinyl records, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - wild Beasts newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz comes from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is difficult to determine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window-window than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records... "she drives off with a dearded sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am pretending to muck jeans pants, I watch a group of young girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crosley disk player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "it is pure" "" "" "" "plate art" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that has most for luxuries such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research yielded that the results of YouGov vote, they are not considered, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and turnouts that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with the bumbling through plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates while avoiding the starling look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who stands above the shoulders of no middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses where persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid, and which contain a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups judged the court that businesses and restaurants would be important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people carrying out the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely trackable."</seg>
<seg id="8">Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is operated in vain and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as counselling to asylum cases for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji distributed a master class in handling, side-stitching, back-up, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The obvious defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But no matter how Fiji in this form would have beaten a 15-man team in top form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have won a gold medal for his neck: Fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This key will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started out miraculous and caused the attacks of GBs to bounce off fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell on and Co. as if one would run into running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, as Osea Kolinisau cleared in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A lively Tackle of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but Fiji has only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Veremalua drove a Touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reunion and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes what was good for the ratios of the first half-time until Joshua Tuiova ran through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a Touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Sea sultry, whose fans sang, flags swinging and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame sat the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis embraced themselves and GB crotched smashed in the turf.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the trainer's cancer to victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinalier than with these games and that's what you want.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder angle up to the last, 220 hard sieves who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when she rusted to the second Olympics in the branch without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all, her 39th unskilled bet, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to incremental advances that make the difference and there was no one more helpful than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day at all.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had a bladder cancer that is operable and that was what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it will spread everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the break to a minimum if it is the right concept in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts came to Williams, who spent a nerve breaking morning to talk more than anything else and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was a Captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said, "This week I was an emotional wreck. this is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeats only how much I and Helen and I have worked as well.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person for training or better coaching.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, panning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "remain in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>

<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "" "" "the work of the Veitenstein group is" "" "" "" "Bavarian" "" "" "" "as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who has been in the kennel association for 31 years, is 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitensteingruppe with its headquarters in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are Kirchner, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunner's mayor in Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed Wasserwart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Purchasing Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they were ranging from water management and maintenance work to office and organisational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency deployment at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, it called the start-up and inauguration of the new well (1994), property purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the reconstruction of the high tank (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and new additions have always been added because water is the most important food in water and drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation, she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of lifeblood for his water-purpose bandage and he has literally lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe to reduce nitrate in front of the water forum of Lower Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller also praised the water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterkeeper and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">He described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights from his point of view.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult task, however, were the quarry at the elevated tank at Kirchlager on a 3rd January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here, at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even the supply of new brunn can only be maintained because one filled the elevated tank of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who replaces Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "singing moves me - emotional and physical," "" "" "" "she describes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">After all, singing from several perspectives is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hacklaters of the German Senior liga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, senior citizens can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal occasion to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from one another - a chorus is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of trouble in everyday life as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that the singing or hearing of songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementia patients are sinking to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To focus simultaneously on one's own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and grow up beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">One doesn't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears it when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can easily join in.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors "choirs can be found on the Internet as well.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who have no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours to help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you like to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">They have suffered cuts and have been treated in the hospital, but have already left them.</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her home journey for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether the further explosions on the vacant island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, so Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital, initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two warheads went up again, according to the authorities another man was killed.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During detonation near the popular bathing beach Patong, a taxi driver was injured according to police indications.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south east coast of the country then another bomb exploded, killing an urban clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device went into the air in a flower bed before the coastguard's precinct.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-eastern coast demanded several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the bomb attacks bear the same handwriting," "" "" "" "said army general Danai Kritériavee Free day before journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we assume that this is a coordinated attack." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express himself to possible motives - but probably the acts of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities would have been receiving intelligence reports on imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police advised its officials throughout the country to reinforce the security surrounding important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used over the years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the present bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (safety level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no need to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elaborated by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which took hold of power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, remembers itself to restore the kingdom again to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack in the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always, the Olympic Games or World Records have the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the Rio de Janeiro's summer games.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Centre the slightly overweighted swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks Habte then became a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his previous race with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 59th position of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporting figure that drew attention from the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why is the 24 year old participating in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special startsheet from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in subdued countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most sportsmen run in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different.</seg>

<seg id="17">His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of freestyle, played no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani ensured media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea as he had to compete on his own in a run over 100 metres of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic meter waste water take place from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / World Group 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (up to now 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the waste water fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a high-level calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf is then at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the household was approved by the District Office of Kulmbach, it was noted that there were undercover for these waste water plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative manager Herbert Schmidt presented to the Supervisory Board, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the period from October 2016 to September 2020, surfacings and / or sub-coverages of the preceding calculation period are to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious charges raised by Schmidt explained that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small, with a very low waste water waste, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result of their age, refurbishment and repair costs continued to be a considerable part of all three plants, not least due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the sewage plant in Azendorf because of damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the world's pump plant, nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up. after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be removed, the sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "on these extraordinary expenses, the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period, have been taken into account."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water waste in the three plants, expenditures for operation and maintenance were "fully interrupted."</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs, has remained spared in the sewer systems over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the above mentioned facilities will continue to be precarious according to stone houses, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater treatment association will not be able to expand, because these facilities are deficient.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, it enables Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are irresistibly rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps are brought to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, Snapchat Filters have criticized critics in which they were accused of promoting the app black face fosters or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When a filter proposed to some users this week, who gave them mud-eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics named it a racist caricature of Asians - "jaundice."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced rattanism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others deciphered the anime-comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely spread that the filter was "injurious and gentle" was unpleasant. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "she added that" "" "" "" "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very nasty Asian caricature and filter effect." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowly-faced, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the degrading extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tributary.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's great audience of young people - who are more different to race diverser than their older opponents - could rather expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it is much harder that such things stay unnoticed than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to erase her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on the media and in a telephone interview, she said that speed-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either I have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that largely left Snapchat unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently hired a personnel officer focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu also said that she will leave her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military kidnapping ISIS intelligence information, establishes Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence intelligence to draw an optimistic view of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on site, a report of the Congress was reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the combatant committees, secret service committees and military budget compromise, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence services typically enjoyed by high-ranking Centcom commanders posted a more positive picture of U.S. efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed illustrated problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic view of the threat of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the congress were significantly more positive than it was the facts." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossulin could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it's so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to play the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings, while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments at ISIL and Iraqi security services," gave the highest-ranking member of the Board of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a position statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this process," "" "" "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "" "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "" "" "announced morale under analysts," "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated not to have found any clues about the intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts with regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General Inspector, who after complaints filed by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress while the investigations of the General Inspector are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "but he also stated that" "" "" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Critique of the Secret Societies of the Islamic State reminiscent of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush encountered only a small occupation force in Iraq and pretended to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker declaring that contrary to the statements of the government air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centres damal commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Immersed in the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events feel steady and inevitable, a fast staggering between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the swimmers to the turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the waiting line in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tower.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognised: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even though trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so scrupulously perceived that many who I had questioned did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline bed has a certain outsider charme, partly because it matches the unenlightened mind that sounds suitable for a clownsschool than that for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-ending swelling - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unifies it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means much like "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Up-and-coming riders jump on a giant trampoline, shoot at almost 30 feet in the air and have to shoot a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they end up on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to official Olympic program, they are judged according to the design, difficulty and flight time.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further high goal in televised transmission: that of the world or the Olympic bay.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even touch a spectator with tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel when watching these games as a bit tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; most of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and the objectives of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long one ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopian just breaking together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into ever more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was merciless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen were firing and killing dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests, which are presumably from the last or early of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Authority requires a thorough investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats across the region, particularly in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was constrained, where dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or sent to prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and don't have any other options apart from protesting, it breaks out," said Zehome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a far-sighted election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions along the border to Eritrea rise; a struggle for this jagged, disputed line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts feared that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which were forced to force more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and be able to arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness may explode after years of falling under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate via social media as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians concluded that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia and predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing right now.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "" "" "said Mulatus Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is largely dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population, dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister until his death at an unpublicized illness in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian's new prime minister, Hailleariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailleariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experiences such a rebellion was 2005, after thousands protest against elections which, according to analysts, seemingly confused by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed even though there were less than in the last few months and this time of turmoil passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misart of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts are saying that the protests of the US and other Western allies are in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for flights to Somalia, even if it announced recently that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama had established ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raises new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings out his fellow campaigners who endeavor to take protection during an eventful period, to explain in the peculiar position, statements which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump cancelled the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning weet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump told in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he strongly criticised himself when he thought that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are accepted by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more etched note, as its polls continued to decline." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Once upon the price of the market, Café in Greenpoint comes back</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a biggy cafe in Williamsburg, where you could pay only bar, which had no Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue shop front were supplanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">The business Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people raped it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel exempted and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, it's also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized club café opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime collaborator of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnings like capers and sauted onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural White Bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many old customers were also pushed by prices from Williamsburg," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Just one Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited the club regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the club closed, she gave up the coffee ham for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it became clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club I liked," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee that is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the beginning of the club in 2003, Tom Rosenthal is another longtime and faithful customer.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I came fourth after seven, every day like a Swiss watch-watch and they prepare my Everything-bagel with butter," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal always gets his usual place, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he had no resentment that the soap business had taken the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for use with the cold-brewed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think we will go to her offer," "" "" "" "Rodriguez said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new client has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon, so that his new neighbours feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice store wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee into the bottles.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers a new verb goes out to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell it," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland shark usually only comes to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland shark has only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average straight 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed it is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, dominated by slowness, seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the trade journal "Science" from a Grönlandhai, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "insanity," "" "" "" "comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, which represents a world record for vertebrates." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland shark became stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius, they usually occur only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland shark.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-slow penteces were measured by them when they exterminated six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadaver, that torpedo from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland shark, the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest proportion was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, the carbon-14 method analyzed the nucleus of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably plenty of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments cast large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimetres of length, the lentil, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 out of the nuclear weapons tests, which is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland shark, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark would be even 392 years old with 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland shark with the increase obviously leave at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is probably the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methusages live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120 year old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they ripen later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal forfeits heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "" "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="8">It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not obligated to do so by law.</seg>

<seg id="3">Four stages were dealt with together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next Rompuy journey of all miniregistrants in two years, the St. Anna senior minister has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various shrines have been tested and one finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the open gate of mercy on Freiburg's Cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 And Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Higerloch, and the hallowed rooms, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Fr. storost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony at St. Anna, blessed the Crucifixion and distributed the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, by train to the start point of Villingen, where also a Münster dearest Lady stands, and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening, depending on a brief impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis made rush to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgrim song booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parish offices of the local parish were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage meetings Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were responsible for a tasty and tonic dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">On top of that, the trip to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, had to be lowered and climbed up to 500 metres when the heat was full.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Badhuspond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter the final stage went to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner was the last evening in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself. the yoke made the legend haughty when he stormed home to capture a victory from the favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place at the World Championships in London in March, despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a sign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who won the race four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner won a match in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was almost back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation when going down in a higher gear to slow it down and make it Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as the BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>

<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally struck by the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>

<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, with a focus on Wiggins.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued yesterday with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura hasn't advanced, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">Following a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas took place in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton technical director in April was in the middle of sexism and bullying reproaches as well as retiring sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But when one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melt of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>

<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effect, as the melting mill consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>

<seg id="14">AGL also stated that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions," which should have come into force from November 2016.</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "from this point on, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the income in the financial year 17," "" "" "" "said the supplier of electricity." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="18">AGL announced that it has already written down the value of the contracts in its annual subscription in the amount of $187 million in "expectation of cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to make the contracts, the "Ability Alcoas... to operate the melt-melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt-cutting" does not interfere.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation of why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>

<seg id="6">This is the clichéd plot of almost every episode episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of dashians has begun with security.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim might have struck her as far as Vogue covers (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is for Vogue the most popular edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference, which rather resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (Accords Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertisement).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is eagerly anticipated that in the last two years the magazine's pictures still leak before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, more "celebrities, modeled" as models, celebrities are on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-prizewinner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if all is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners likes success not everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised them and called them "the mistletins of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings turned up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But on the displeasure seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your priming Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall-apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells pictures of her daughter Cindy Crawford's daughter to the LOVE magazine.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is seen in reality TV. probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (September 4) and Berlin (18 September) considerable losses are notable for the government parties of the SPD and the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys conducted by the INSA opinion research institute for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could barely rule in the North, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to head the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD overthrew 35.6 percent from five years to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party only paralyzed the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is contested between the Left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (18.4 percent previously), the AfD would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite the slight losses of 6 per cent (previous 8.7 per cent), the Greens returned to Schwerin Landtag.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator entered the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather clunky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would suffice today for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 99000 communicator" arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the business - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, fans can buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the InterNet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit trade fair in Hanover, Germany, as an "West liner office."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was accessible.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even accessing web pages was possible via HTML browsers, though tormented slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was pretty proud: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could imagine in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns' cell phone segment experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market is dominated by providers who all came a lot later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, this is a daily routine for many people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion units sold, Samsung and Apple account for 555 million units alone.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecom companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Meanwhile a whole industry has been created around the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs did the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac-World.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, all by touch screen easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's triumphal march was still the most important product of the Group today.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the look.</seg>
<seg id="35">She finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The saws now have Apple and Asian vendors such as Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average, every German now looks 88 times a day on his cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we all have to learn to get rid of the smartphone," "" "" "" "said Janina Ball, in charge of the Siemens Management Board." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies who earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software vendors trying to bypass advertising blocking, a "cat and mouse game" is the same.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blogging on its desktop page, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it told users to update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook shared with the fact that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements in order to complicate recognition of the recognition of which part of the page advertising is.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams, spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams, wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-forth battle has been underway since the invention of display blowers" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how high concern indicators have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe some 200 million people worldwide use display blockers; almost four times as much as 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertisers' revenue.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight.</seg>

<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, took the court.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabited once according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once could have rejected similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protect against faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus highlights its day-side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain producing a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution that was previously thought by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans are evaporated and their water vapour blasted away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen withstood only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect, the Venus, as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Sternenhaufen of the Pleiades</seg>
<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star-pile rotate to different rates as well as in which context the rotational periods with planetary formation are standing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star hotels, learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sternenhaufen of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these maturing stars repel large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnet-fields of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aging, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less solid stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars turn more slowly pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull commented.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the star-pile of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the Sternenhaufen of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull commented.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is much ahead of us about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports extensively about their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say goodbye to Goodbye," explained the 14-time all-star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>

<seg id="11">With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays only two more baseball players are showing similar values in the most important statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the ballroom of the baseballs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A learned athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimming teacher Chen Xinyi, 3000 metre obstacle-runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski, were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions this news came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was proven to be used as a masking drug for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly, just 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the events more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the International Olympic Committee (IOC) the opening of the B-trial and a hearing have been requested.</seg>

<seg id="13">For the first time in history is not the IOC, but the CAS responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also at the night of Rio the news of the positive trial of Danekova filtered through, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "" "" "she said to Bulgarian TV station BNT." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report, it should act with the banned substance of the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova suspended, according to BNT, the B-specimen should already have a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported his criticism of the bulletin.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier than his brother Tomasz.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, however, both should not start in the class up to 94 kilos.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, especially the Danekova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world association IAAF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for the exception of systematic doping, and the country of Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming sport, the earlier contracts in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when I see the podium more than 200 m Freestyle, I want to commit myself," "" "" "" "said Lacourt in the French Radio." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="32">Sun had been tested positively by the Chinese champions in 2014 on the stimulant trimetacidin, but had to leave only a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data lau: so perfide blackmages hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail servers are currently targeting enterprises - and they are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware Abwehr specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once in the past twelve months, partly multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of companies already had the goal of ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the money required by the perpetrators to re-use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators clearly specialize their blackmail software on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential for extortion money is considerably higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks resulted in a frightening pace over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or Database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackpress.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stagnates.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of Germany's affected companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had even had to stop business operations completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acute by the loss of acute attacks.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "" "" "explains Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the call of the perpetrators in view of standstill in operation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the Safety Researchers of F-Secure examined the user interfaces and the contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support sites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing their jobs, says security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware-kits have been created by providing malware, advice, and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "" "" "says Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then search for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set by a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is done per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with dissemination," "" "" "" "explains Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the company's IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on the ability to repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful performance, the perpetrators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could have completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat associated with the internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, such a blockaded heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit upper side is a little bit off.</seg>

<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rev areas.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his work a bit quieter.</seg>

<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign recognition and throttles speed on demand.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and an HDMI bush are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>

<seg id="7">The big advantage: traffic splits early, thus improving the overall procedure on the busy section of the federal road 51.</seg>

<seg id="2">The weather has caused the shooting of stars in south-west Germany on the night to Friday, but there is still hope.</seg>
<seg id="3">The night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the sky's spectacle, said the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our hope is on the night to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The weather should be good, then we'll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="6">The shooting stars are Perseids, which are among the quickest shooting stars with 216000 kilometers per hour.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning is far ahead of the wake-up bells no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but restorative.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adult sleeping disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep is frequent or permanent as not restorative.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes for them, emphasises Hans-Günter WeChat, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Medicine and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being, however, is the Insomnia, thus a single and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people consider staying asleep as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German house doctor association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioural-related factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "very early awakening is most common in depression," "" "" "" "says Wealth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are mutually dependent.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who have a herniated disc, for example, can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and start thinking about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I consult your doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, advises Waiting.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: you are beaten, tired, indelible, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like gastric or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic slaughtering tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any medical practitioner in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, when sleeping problems should be directed to the primary doctor, she advises to eat too.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, with snoring with breathing holes, in case of disease-related fatigue, for sleeping-converters, or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "only do not take a nap," "" "" "" "says Fietze." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After clacking, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-mask, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera draws on the ceiling of the sleeping-ends.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few screws on which you can set up for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">What matters is that regular sleeping and upsetting, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleeping, avoid alcohol and not watch the clock in the night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmer Markus Deibler expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing tailoring of the DSV-Team at Olympus.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he first took Gold at the short-track world championships in Doha and at the same time set his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler via Facebook put himself in front of his ex teammate in front of his criticism.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 €bonus and a jungle of €150,000 no one should wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="6">The conveyor system in swimming sport is bad, whereas doping controls are very good.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden baths, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from the east to the west, one passes by playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly" has sprayed on the façade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy neighborhood," as the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls, in recent weeks, however, is favored by burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have rent contracts, but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin senator Henkel had spoken multiple times for a hard action of the police against the project, called the area as a "No-Go zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After three weeks of official statements were cleared on the ground floor, the cadre-smiths, with 300 police officers, the police patrolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team-cars on-site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers removed from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain in front of late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has brought up three children, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted more police protection against the vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin-based senator and the police open between home occupants and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer road close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was swept under large police forces in a real street fight, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and ballads from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents of the GDR times and former home occupiers are sharing their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on raised discs or freshly painted facades that have been filled with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "no other street was mentioned this year so often with the words" "" "" "" "Linked Autonomous Violence" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are causing damage, which tends to make new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived for 17 years in a tenant house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">In terms of violence, it is important: people in 94 are their neighbors, they were not meant to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer any longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, the street is not a criminal offence, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously dragged into the Riga road - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important for them that the residents get their streets back: from the police, politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claimed the distinctiveness of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless newbuildings in former building houses, which the old residents displace.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is, in the end, condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well drunk," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For those who like colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the leftist scene belonged to the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw, should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub, can complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for the integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Refugee Agency for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact partner for all stakeholders: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else interferes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eighty Wollmilchsau, who has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less sneezing on the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative manager with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an experienced Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was high time," "" "" "" "says Regine client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full time players." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the washing line</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these lodgings must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the board of directors to the commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work, unless one relies on private dwellings, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be solidified, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be placed in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent lead, there are internships, apprenticeships, training places, one-euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be grounded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "" "" "Regine client reports." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for community will result in a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "this is" "" "" "" "no employment therapy" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But work does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">This means that administration and honorary officials jump here as well.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you must explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling at some point will not help anyone in Urbach but should not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">The work of Deuschle and his customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "" "" "all this is already a mammoth task." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent occurrences, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine's customer clearly says, "what some naive might call." a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they would have the fear that the killers put them in complete retribution." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "" "" "Regine said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to spot them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "" "" "Annika Deuschle says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's client also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
