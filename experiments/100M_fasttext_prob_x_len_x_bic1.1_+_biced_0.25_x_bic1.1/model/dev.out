Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critici@@ zes Israel &apos;s ongoing expansion of housing and suggests Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear program has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the Republi@@ can invitation before the US Congress , which was part of an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call is Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb made the fatal emergency call after it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and collabor@@ ators knew about him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal background .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ ination to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said that he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb launched its work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Pe@@ dago@@ gy .
he completed his doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together for some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail rose both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss night on night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of the Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and attended a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght ceremony , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial , while the University Choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect the fact that the police are now saying that Lamb opened the emergency call after having shot Schmidt , and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that they have ever been married .
To@@ ys R Us is planning to hire less workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and businesses are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip their employees who sell , send and deliver products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre wait for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an ar@@ mes@@ ial length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN CEO once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive talks on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the meeting of the General Assembly during this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban calls on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity when tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ can try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp off from the top ranks in poll@@ s , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC@@ s and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp staying power and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
mps Som@@ e@@ thing values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University survey revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P vote would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
only two out of 10 would say they were &quot; angry &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees Tru@@ mp temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the nation &apos;s first dial @-@ up state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not pass into the White House , as ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their guard hats , republi@@ can voters hold tru@@ mp for real .
when asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey from last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is clear that a large number of GO@@ P voters are viewing the Tru@@ mp campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp still beats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp leadership , while the anti @-@ mp support is scattered across more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can Can@@ did@@ ates , Tru@@ mp is harvesting multi@@ lateral support .
he was ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp are saying that they have forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six of the 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on the issue of immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign recently called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; immig@@ rant from Mexico two months ago , immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep critical His@@ pan@@ o Americans out of the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration .
so long as immigration in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght remains , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders .
six of the 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they &apos;re also angry at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hear@@ tless angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof @-@ roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - hence the high price .
a new study shows in which special locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top living places , however , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros nothing - per square meter , mind you .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ schu@@ ze in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it was running .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze presented a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of Train@@ ers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ dies ( 8@@ 9. ) ear@@ ns at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller was rewarded with his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a f@@ lange of the world champion &apos;s flan@@ k .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich word .
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including some well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled over here .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran bol@@ dly in their offensive efforts , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous to work .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on Link@@ sau@@ lt Douglas Costa , which seldom went through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field hit the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es head ball from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians were playing domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set con@@ i@@ fers .
on the door@@ keeper of Manuel Neu@@ er , however , he was reli@@ eved .
for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola released a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside at first .
the World Cup hero only gave the green light after finishing the final training , said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something else from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the slain Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ m Müller made a bet .
before the game it was at the stadium for craw@@ ling .
after a smaller group of flo@@ ated Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block obviously provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and ki@@ cked off against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : ren@@ unci@@ ation reduces the risk quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes of tooth loss are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ising the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years before the risk of falling to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Rev@@ . Thomas Dietrich from the British University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health until high age , according to our findings .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of dental unemployment divided the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking may increase the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .
archae@@ ologists reach from Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants of the late Anti@@ quity .
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the ump@@ teenth time .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a technical office for archaeological conservation .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , the arch@@ e@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it was already known that in the place of the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over the TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to tigh@@ ten the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which , in its function , corresponds significantly to more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström , Commissioner responsible for the idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed to bring the proposal as a European bar@@ gaining position to the US free trade talks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TTIP calls for the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
a second instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
so far , the parties involved agreed among themselves on arbit@@ ration judges , and there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system do not trust fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clari@@ fied there .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings demanded above all by major corporations ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , with the companies liable for damages to tax@@ pa@@ yers who can negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act cited the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was critici@@ zed above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
on the other hand , the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , described the plans as a major step forward .
the Commission took into account key issues in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
it remained unclear when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) have been concluded .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should already stand at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d folk artist has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s presentation .
he tells the story of various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ousness and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were born and what it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; intellig@@ ently composed songs seem to blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late 60s , but can always drift to opul@@ ent opul@@ ent songs .
the rum@@ or of &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ ary series : each of the 50 states in the United States should be considered as a consequence .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens steps down here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
in 2005 , &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ) is a highly celebrated masterpiece .
exu@@ ber@@ antly of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no yearly list of influential music media .
after highly productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies heavily on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) .
this sixth record studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b .
away from the smaller clubs , the stage shows are shown here for the colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens tou@@ red Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the significantly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide @-@ enriched album .
from the audience one hears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; disk in essence . &quot;
first at an en@@ core St@@ ev@@ ens is humble , plays an acoustic few older songs and eventually bows down under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; A
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q @-@ Q has been eag@@ erly awaited since his election .
the new leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his debut at the prime minister &apos;s Q &amp; A and will be making his debut with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from close quarters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns as it comes after his appointment as member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , critic@@ ises a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several news articles in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news@@ night program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; irrespective of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow mini@@ esters have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ acks &quot; within the Labour Party and Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the restriction on profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes pre@@ tend to remove the whole idea of a limit overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised another policy set , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from stri@@ pping and stri@@ pping with re@@ tain@@ ers instead of focusing on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of Economic Council , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also put the idea into conversation that other colleagues may occasionally take the word , and that he called John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; punch theatre &quot; that is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ y . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the prime minister was seen as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the sub @-@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed extensive reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound was sky@@ rock@@ eted after data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s objective .
earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % between May and July compared to the same period in the previous year .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .

Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth .
Gl@@ en@@ core stocks rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion through a share sale as part of his strategy of reducing debt .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company R@@ ating to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , having reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster puts Lebanese on a potato dum@@ pl@@ ings idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - namely in the potato twe@@ eter , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a plac@@ ard of Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes rather than D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television .
since then there &apos;s a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that &apos;s Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has now been submitted by Lebanese to the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y just how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met@@ cash starts resistance campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - inf@@ estation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branches ahead of an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ a has launched a resistance campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ a and I@@ GA Super@@ markets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners selling cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ a will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler will conduct its annual investment strategy day for food , alcohol and equipment .
it is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets , Al@@ di will take away around five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose € 360 million in sales a year and cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of a high fixed cost basis could cost about $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes .
at the same time Met@@ a loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will drop sales in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported at a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ a will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ a refused to publicly respond to the comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ a has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , the i@@ G@@ AS market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailer , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction at simultaneous pressures on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , def@@ ends itself and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compete with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through fast growing fresh foods and providing a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustments and charging plans for El@@ an will rise and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm round his friend Nick S@@ isi and deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior according to the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght by the in@@ famous Kyr@@ gy@@ z conflict with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka in the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , and Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have hit S@@ isi , and I should hit the child . &quot;
as he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp was ver@@ ting a potential US Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite rich is the fact that , in my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ it .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan at the important preliminary decision , which starts on Friday and describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think that Nick made the climb very quickly , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray made . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally come to the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants arrested themselves in a man &apos;s land and responded with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian government police .
some returned from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic , Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a disputed meeting in Brussels not to agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ cor@@ rupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a prompt action from Brussels or its neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were employed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the emerging economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree with the military use of the military that is expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ porters have watched heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Landes @-@ security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ zing a crowd to push themselves there .
some 20 managed to get involved , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders receives her from the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced yet whether he is can@@ did@@ ates for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the elections .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some gains .
Clinton keeps a huge margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have reduced .
their support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders only comes back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ figure advantage in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who are not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of the pres@@ election democratic voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president will be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and elec@@ ti@@ bility are also quoted .
as the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the prim@@ aries , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den does not qualify for nomin@@ ating the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders increases from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the question of what is more important to a candidate call the Democratic People &apos;s questions on the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much like last month , no democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elections spark@@ ed as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features of voters in the prim@@ aries of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best with hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say it about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinions about it .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as Foreign Minister continues to be questioned , most demo@@ cra@@ cies of the prim@@ aries are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it still worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy from the voters of their party , this remains a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tru@@ mp still have good scores for guidance .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush perform best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son finds himself close behind Donald Tru@@ mp in the recent C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support in the new survey is om@@ itted by the two Can@@ did@@ ates , and others lose their support dramatically
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out in front of Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son arrives well with demographic groups and that Tru@@ mp is sur@@ passing under republi@@ can constitu@@ ents with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen down the lowest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former governor of Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support among Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest pol@@ l news from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp a lot ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even more warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people are no longer in the sea : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
sea temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a postpon@@ ement of a student &apos;s connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g as a brutal attack during an initiation ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital .
officials said he was charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to move over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , thus the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils , and basically asked the welfare of the Brotherhood about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ vot@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning in his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with mu@@ te force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died since 1970 every year on the ch@@ ic@@ anes , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for murder of the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be accoun@@ table to them , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest rates
a rise in interest comes , and the domestic demand is stag@@ gering , loans for bonds will rise and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond .
for this reason , representatives of the US Central Bank have so v@@ ehem@@ ently pointed out that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was perhaps exagger@@ ated because of a rise in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency for asset income to be trimmed 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study on what happens after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases .
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rate , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis that published Bob D@@ oll , Head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the hei@@ gh@@ tening cycle and the yield begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate of interest in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 price increases since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few anticipate that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants agreed to raise interest in the F@@ ed all year , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC may approve an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade will only increase by 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all reductions from 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing vig@@ our in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists have been in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far .
the firm income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds , the returns seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the loans dropped immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to margins closer together between longer and shorter bonds and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest rates often lead to better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
Jones thinks the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing has expanded and volati@@ lity continues - all the features of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and large companies operating the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are becoming worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate rise , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ analysts said in a report for the customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their lower quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher income , even if experts of different opinion are how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the broad@@ caster for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mm@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked The Voice and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , claims a leading MP and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private tran@@ smit@@ ters do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer have to be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC general director recalls the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work must be made to engage the audience than they did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for the commercial ri@@ vals .
T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wished that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time a series of entertainment starts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fans for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased slow@@ ed in August and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed output in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
however , experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phone purchases .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the em@@ itting revenues .
experts believe buyers will hold their purchases in front of this event , which will take place on Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca during crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims during the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia reli@@ eves the collapse partially of the vast Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane pl@@ ung@@ ed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the killed who were killed as a crane at Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ sch@@ ee collap@@ sed .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track in order to clo@@ g their respect when the first of the dead took their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ved gra@@ ve@@ yard .
the mour@@ ning procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a crane crow@@ ding through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then upon the worshi@@ ppers r@@ ushed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi King compla@@ ined about the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 bet@@ ers who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , as the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
the Saudi officers have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said that the arm of the crane should not have stopped when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which r@@ ushed into an inner courtyard of the giant mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later this month was taking place .
the Bin Laden Group did not release any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ duc@@ ed the group because of the lack of current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
Ben Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a de@@ ceased son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is necessary at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials indicated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss is saying that the time of cheap Eastern European tra@@ des@@ people is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly busy cra@@ ft@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled trades people from Eastern Europe has led to an increase
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops targeting professional tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q stores nationwide will close
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down its h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes .
if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British employ more and more tra@@ des@@ people to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , the boss of the company behind the B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , who offer services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and closing 60 retail outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions are made by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that have more female single households than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women listed on the head of a UK leader in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company occupying exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year earnings and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and spending ev@@ asion on Wednesday .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he was acqu@@ itted in May of this accus@@ ation .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , the investigation revealed that the defend@@ ants used funds from Club accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to use their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the president of the Sho@@ v@@ eller , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time the association had ar@@ isen a financial disadvantage .
the sports officials were only charged with compens@@ atory damages and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the Passi@@ vi@@ va amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance policies as security at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the receipt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debt .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , reimbur@@ sement of expense allowance was decided retro@@ actively by 1991 .
therefore one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore , package and not detailed bookings also appeared , the former ob@@ st@@ ant explained the proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accounts and Sav@@ ings Bank shared the two accused together , said the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for financial hard@@ ship , it was important to have been only the freedom of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 an official investigation was initiated against an official abuse , an amount of 120@@ .000 euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , decl@@ aring the defend@@ ants .
this securities account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim res@@ titu@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why damage compensation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wording because the association never suffered a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all from the cutter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
he added 1.000 euros per month to diets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years were not able to prove the defend@@ ants .
these were no longer stored after an audit in which everything was assessed correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant had also obtained o@@ dom@@ eter money .
all the deport@@ ations were made in cash , in order to do so he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard adds 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff reduction that has been running for three years , the Compu@@ Tr@@ i will work on further jobs when it comes to spl@@ itting the company .
the stops at the US @-@ Compu@@ te H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 spots in its corporate customer branch .
as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be incurred as of the fourth quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 5@@ 5.000 jobs running for three years has not yet been completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP had around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
in the after@@ market , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share declined by 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , a large corporation with printers , is currently split up : in this way , the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services offset the world &apos;s second @-@ largest manufacturer of PC manufacturers .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP rep@@ lies with spl@@ itting up and massive positions on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more stores right online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would mostly result in rejection : 54 per cent opposed it , 35 percent agreed .
the fact that other countries are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
in contrast , 24 percent are involved in the conflict .
a cooperation with the Syrian leader , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , declined 51 percent of those surve@@ yed , 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second press @-@ day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
at the heart of the fair , up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility are at the heart of the fair .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility . &quot;
the wide audience can attend the International Motor Show of Saturday .
as two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA Verband anticipate around 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Hungarian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used tear gas and water @-@ th@@ row@@ er at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gut@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ lights .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line was formed and a water designer was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials un@@ ce@@ as@@ ingly set a pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas shou@@ ted .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surve@@ yed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was still the last week of view that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the present level will last from 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may possibly leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Managing Director at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions .
it warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Ear@@ th@@ cap at Delta State University left sorry
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; I &apos;m sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot someone , and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb had 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , like his c@@ law on the university &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands its tribute .
row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the 1000 management executives around the world will cost the work of the Group in the workplace .
with the pilot trade union , however , there are new negotiations .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the budget of Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was to make a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no more executive board for the passenger business in the future .
the budget airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the future , the Executive Board of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the role of Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphasizes the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 strong company was complex .
airlines operate under the umbrella of the airline group , which represents three quarters of annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of collective bar@@ gaining with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations after the court @-@ packed strike on this Thursday should be resum@@ ed .
that divided the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forecast result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming to fru@@ i@@ tion as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline has led to several strikes in recent months .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United cannot play for months because of double Fra@@ k@@ tur
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double cont@@ our of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions @-@ League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the lef@@ tist foreign champion to cry and close it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w entered the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , has it very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had a oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture it will take six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I get stronger again . &quot;

Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you almost know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided on The Lor@@ ax , which appeared in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead re@@ produces an ingredient of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; you read . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Ho@@ sel was l@@ ur@@ king and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads like the summary of the lau@@ ax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears , as the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ lum@@ ber@@ ing , thri@@ ving Once @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , an ho@@ ck@@ ly , whis@@ per@@ ing being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text was probably coming from Camer@@ oon &apos;s poll@@ ing bure@@ au .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but gave no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a awa@@ y@@ victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , mos@@ ques Ali emerged as Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown magnitude on test level , is an option for the attack .
this is related to this : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyse as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I have said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully , if he goes out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his position , even though he did not bring such good achievements , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and for@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England initially translated Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he &apos;s a drummer , who I appreciate very much .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge room , which met us a lot .
it must have at least the same chances as those before it , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and get four squ@@ e@@ aks appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed man has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s box of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before joining Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ eds strai@@ gh@@ ta@@ way and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the ca@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ eg , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master@@ stroke .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with what is said before .
Coll@@ ey &apos;s team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not employed at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers do not define the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
Bre@@ x@@ it ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy falls into a sl@@ um@@ ber by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n as leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which strongly tore up because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at @-@ law recently said that some member states , as deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of its own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance scra@@ m@@ ble at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wants an outside Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have arrived in some major cities to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it has happened in the exagger@@ ated long run @-@ outs like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also an al@@ lied force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one as it did during the referendum not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can feel weak at Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ paying villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ hack@@ ers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum as Bla@@ ir had set the principle on the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems in danger to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ s , an error back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe - I say it is kind - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional anti @-@ ar@@ b@@ ant tendency and wild gra@@ ces of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness may well say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ett &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father on television tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour &apos;s cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his co @-@ workers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the controversial bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as said by Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks this way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite loading economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is deeply convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something at the start on Monday of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence presented by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes Champions , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the Tob@@ acco Control of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e cigar@@ ettes have been premature as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison to this , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has a clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people each year die in a disease related to smoking , and smoking rates the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear provision of recent evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programmes like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , likely to be seen by a smaller audience , against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs give or send programs that would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to pay the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put its production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the best possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s obviously non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I would like to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for valu@@ ations due to the ambi@@ tions of people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ ed@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue when they go to their seem@@ ing missions for justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the Committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value here .
of course , all of us think we all think that for £ 150 a year you get a great value here , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is right , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission &quot; to inform , to educ@@ ate and to enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example at public television stations in Australia and Canada , &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on motor @-@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that react to ultrasound waves .

the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics that ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that indicates electrical impulses in people &apos;s brain to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass through un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the happy voice and cartoon pictures show no doubt that this ad for the world &apos;s largest weapons fair is a milit@@ ant par@@ o@@ dy produced by Am@@ nesty International to put weapons to repres@@ sive regimes across the Defence and Security Equipment International Jam@@ bor@@ ee in the Excel Centre in London &apos;s Do@@ ck@@ lands .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you read in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into an image of a tank .
in September , a flock of arms dealers will travel with the DL@@ R ... Custom@@ ers are asked to assist in stopping the weapons fair .
the 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Illu@@ str@@ ated Design in Bank@@ sys Pro@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Si h@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ &quot; pack of Allen keys , claimed to &quot; gain access to about one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;

according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will get critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists engage with activists in protest movements to work and realize that they have to move outside into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters gre@@ ets commuters in the subway .
the Am@@ nesty @-@ Video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works for non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist , who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapons fair - through a void of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blu@@ ei@@ sh with bright colours and animation will keep it stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is an intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally from our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the Ce@@ MAT comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors dev@@ ise fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student homes
eleven years ago I moved into a student residence as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have been angry - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the moving into student homes ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to talk about : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , if and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ary , where you stand with regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk with even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
people often turn into drinks reception , film @-@ night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and put their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted people receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of it : do it .
a guy in my student homes had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship include baking .
since you start college at the high point of the back man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to introduce themselves to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mis@@ cell@@ aneous lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you kno@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced way than my room@@ mate , who added a pur@@ ge to their milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if they had something to make Drum &amp; Bass a bit qui@@ eter because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut up her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same residence hall ?
on the contrary , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to her , dis@@ connect and then see her every day and perhaps see how she moves across all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good punch is funny , but it takes only moments when it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water that you put then in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the single mother and the low ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly a favorable living space can be created : he is building terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a large part here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the face of the flood of refugees , we need plenty of living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it makes integration easier .
this is different in bringing people into blocks of living .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have copy@@ ri@@ ghted my project right now .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking space ordin@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the space missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury facilities for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not correct .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true is it : in the past five years we had a building boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even everyday people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the self @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
I show how one can still build cheap and well today .
that &apos;s what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple release is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing in &quot; General , &quot; and then &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling you that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean that apps can be deleted to create space - but Apple has done that by cutting the update more impro@@ b@@ able . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete .
it is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is close to a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch off half@@ way and this could lead to a dis@@ continuation of the updates .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has recorded another member in its ranks , so the membership increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the vehicle of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which Chairman Alfred Klein received .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his solidarity with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the nursing home of Anton@@ istics have joined the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg site .
in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the social foundation is pulling it down from the mountain into the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice on information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of the health and care funds .
for years we have established with our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are infinitely many questions .
&quot; many performances of the insurance companies are not rarely claimed , because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new hous@@ eholder Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ istics and the hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders will see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in the demographic transition .
for this reason , a good de@@ centralized infrastructure is essential in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular convi@@ vial ambi@@ ance . &quot;
in doing so , the Foundation makes a huge contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and good as possible in their familiar environment .
the office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days between 16 : 00 and 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men then scre@@ amed the young man and struck him with his fist on his face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al bone frac@@ ture and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their home and drove past demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
with the help of a strike @-@ stick , one beat on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
up to now only a vag@@ ue bag description lies ahead .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ tig breaks and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple mil@@ ler liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
however , they will still live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K readiness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting September 19 , the practice is prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ lar@@ ges@@ s works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ onic examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 euros will be provided by the Müll@@ ers as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into the field of field breaks each quarter , in the north@@ western German average there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor found himself , it would have gone too .
anyone who visits Müll@@ ers consultations also looks above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Gr@@ ön@@ ausen re@@ members smiling .
a little melanch@@ oly has already felt it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I &apos;ve always pushed myself from gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Johanna Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum claim is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and possibly er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia doesn &apos;t want to ban its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby fields of corn .
according to local media , ever since , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles with new refugees continue to arrive .
it is a matter of Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also being used .
in the coming days his country will have about 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo would be diver@@ ted to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , re@@ directed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade Government denied that it was meant to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could lead to a shift in the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not call for details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &apos; comprehensive possibilities of border control &apos; .
you perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since then consistently issued a good testimony concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down the debate on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature birth .
it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
car@@ egi@@ vers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchange h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which has been accused of providing insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information obtained , insi@@ der transactions should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 other accused in the event continued .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are expected to act in both the US and Eastern Europe .

puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with stunning autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large panels with the heading &quot; Bev@@ or I want to die .... &quot;
with this action the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid atten@@ tively drew attention to her 20th anniversary and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well for questions and talks as the volunteers .
while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously acc@@ esses to the chal@@ k and &quot; read my life , &quot; &quot; can read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; Stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others stop briefly , read , say phrases as &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action in itself , about life , the handling of dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realise that sometime the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Mannheim Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical work , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ band@@ wagon bearer of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still tain@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped a lot to open people .

when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid was consul@@ ted by the call of honour , she reported immediately and was present at the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and their relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce St. Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .

the offer of the ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as training and supervision of the mortality and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ants .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result bl@@ ended , financial prospects for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his earnings outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous pre@@ diction .
according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 .
the lower view is despite the price increases which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ging of heavy and large packages , which will be raised in November .
the company said it was nonetheless expected that the result would increase over the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid earnings when considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ ack &apos;s Investment Research analy@@ st .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analy@@ st surve@@ yed by Z@@ ack expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , bringing sales to stagn@@ ation in its express delivery unit .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales were up 29 per cent in bo@@ d@@ ging , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labour costs in freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on its most awaited conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the prime interest for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States finds itself threatened by an end of the ornam@@ ented , two @-@ storey seat hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed leader Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has a tw@@ o@@ fold mandate from Congress : maintaining US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently surve@@ yed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts reduce the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value grew by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the proposition this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rise in interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago the F@@ ed seemed to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the rate of proposition expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed considers to be full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ Davi@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets all over the world came together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , with the Dow lowered by almost 10 % from May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred during the past few weeks , they would put on rein in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world &apos;s currency .
the impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere suggestion of Ben S. Bern@@ anke , then , in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down their monetary expansion , &quot; triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Asset Management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to raising interest rates , refer@@ enced decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia has led the F@@ ed to lower its rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ier .
a year later the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed those cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rates .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 L@@ ess@@ ons .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home on D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there , it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to explain in sho@@ cking ways women about how important good nutrition is during breast @-@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried permitted the construction contract for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar installation .
the planning for the lon@@ ged gymnas@@ tics hall on the Bern@@ ried Sports ground is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council meeting , the completed construction contract was unanim@@ ously lowered without major discussions .
previously , the Board had , among other things , adopted an application for a &quot; legal &quot; exception &quot; respect &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
with the &quot; exception &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction .
according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ cohesi@@ ve first and roof over@@ hang &quot; is to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; liberation &quot; period , again , the roof ti@@ lt , which for energetic reasons - was required - otherwise than in the development plan - should be below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
for this reason , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the development plan with respect to the roof ti@@ lt allowed no &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby Bern@@ ried &apos;s municipal council is usually more restric@@ tive when it comes to liber@@ ating orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project at turn@@ table construction : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym hall building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros will be calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tude promotion .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be presented to the Land@@ lord &apos;s Office for the examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new Medical Director at the Hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the District GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision will be made by the Supervisory Board , and this will be postpon@@ ed to Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority were to move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing inner station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who to start the succession , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in any case means an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a dis@@ sem@@ ination of the offer in &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
for the next two years , if the supervisory board agrees to agree , both houses will lead , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app , which still has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , if the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ens @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a conference clinic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity never comes back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very comprehensive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real prospect for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was constantly threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

Jag@@ ha@@ zy with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in action , as the police communicated .
after a shooting , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals .
at first it was unclear how exactly this incident could happen .
the det@@ ective police are investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds who have been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in interro@@ gation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to have killed the young people and threw their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the prosec@@ utor and the police on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also arrested on Tuesday evening , is deemed to have been suspected of having jurisdiction and leading investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the body .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning , after she hadn &apos;t come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of a young woman , investig@@ ators initially met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted to the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the bodies were placed in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ ner on Wednesday , investig@@ ators make him a burden for him .
the further investigations are to shed light on the circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long ago begun .
with the arriving refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : in Germany 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed this year .
in this way 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were lod@@ ged in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant savings in housing policy in recent years .
Germany fires a housing deficit that grows from year to year .
currently some 77@@ ,000 residential units have already been missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , compla@@ ining Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals , therefore , were living in large cities with a need for accommodation in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the sl@@ um@@ ps on the housing market .
in large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has decreased again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is propos@@ ing a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for social housing .
this could be wai@@ ved for the transfer tax and the property tax on subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be temporarily suspended .
in addition , attractive tax depreciation options are necessary according to the alliance .
the refugee shel@@ ters of the state bank Kf@@ W are already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was spent on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros already more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free mobility : Croatia and Slovenia lift a corridor
after Hungary practically no passing through more , more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announced that the transit of Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Home Secretary R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the expul@@ sion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have erup@@ ted to Croatia in order to reach Europe from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
on the eve of the day , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into effect on the same day make regular asylum procedures in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with both the bus and the taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across border f@@ ences .
for this the border strip bears other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
after the closing of the border , Hungary , however , hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before the closing date on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damaging of the Gren@@ zz@@ av@@ us as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and the expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; on Tuesday , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees .
practically no one has any chance to grant asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few hundred refugees assembled in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers start to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border resort was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this conversion .
only a few refugees arrive after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country has also strengthened its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country , according to government figures .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by orders of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the clearing up when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany was surprisingly shut down on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
previously we did not even sti@@ fle the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we have said the same thing , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler at the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train to Passa@@ u , in order to make it possible after the announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
however , the regional train was turned off in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn before the border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ firmly united with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , Sunday before a two @-@ bridge run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of helping to establish structures in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp right away , our Chancellor has officially and publicly sponsored the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis der Naz@@ ism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to note that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great challenge to establish decent conditions for protective seekers in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the coming winter .
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof neighbour@@ hoods
with the support of refugees , Con@@ rad has all hands full to do .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks to deliver neighbour@@ hoods for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already managed to get a grip on the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen first @-@ catching centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no longer homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , said Con@@ rad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
altogether , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the year @-@ long year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the provincial capitals .
they would have assured him to also create neighbor@@ hoods for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria , it &apos;s good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help as we do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is also great expectations for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ORF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it is not possible for district providers to maintain a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to be valid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , was successful with his experience .
I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say un@@ truth without further into the face .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Con@@ rad and Ma@@ ier do not inc@@ ur any costs to the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the search for qu@@ arti@@ s has not been successful until now .
Con@@ rad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz demands a better division
for the time being no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since people are currently unable to implement these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the city chief critic@@ ises the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a prolonged telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the provincial governor Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ ded further action in the refugee issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
the protective seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again demanded greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the industrial row in Linz is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million has been invested by S &amp; T at the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade in a nut@@ shell : after all , she has now gained gain in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a place where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz metropol@@ itan area who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has put Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
most of all , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can also not answer the professional woman with the last certainty .
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag deplo@@ ys every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place called en@@ co@@ ders .
some people also connect to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ ups .
whether he expresses himself hostile to foreign journalists , concerns journalists or reveals gaps in knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presi@@ dency inspir@@ es the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with its fo@@ eh@@ n hair@@ style is a term for many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related over -@@ ump@@ teen corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt fashion , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , among which Tru@@ mp also includes the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tru@@ mp who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y comes to word in Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , it tends to be the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in high German : the en@@ co@@ ders , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tru@@ mp is coming from the village of the en@@ co@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant in the USA for gold dig@@ gers .
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland for a long time failed at the Bavarian State , to which the at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not admit Tru@@ mp , because he was once dismissed without permission , had declared the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , to the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements by the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as they pol@@ lu@@ te , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp who was born in Op@@ a ) .
the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks more distant to the American , &quot; he is always so four thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension fund Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ y@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t give the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ o@@ cher Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the lost leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has not been any major shifts in the Today &apos;s Reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the down@@ side seemed to play no role in Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five major cities compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ at@@ y father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit lightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 pm ) of the new qui@@ z show hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe resulted in an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half @-@ hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators on Monday evening and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half of the hour .
average of 6@@ 20,000 Hot @-@ Se@@ at .
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will convince N@@ ine that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to over@@ lap the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood ends in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips tight to the final on Thursday tightly sealed
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki - besides themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams Energi@@ es noticed , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week the house visit made her clear that Wood &quot; could be the One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly hired on him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ ot in such a way as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ts at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and Hay@@ ne gave the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porters Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his late catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 , when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free voters are calling for the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn clas@@ hing in Groß@@ mass@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dation in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sunday fraction of the free voters ad@@ jour@@ ned to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually , other main topics were provided .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will shift the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as they were during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must stick to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor Head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to push free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts in charge of asylum claims : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards across Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria push@@ es away , others are not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more competent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ thu@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long standing torch will remain on the agenda : the education policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the new school year , Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; middle @-@ level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the secondary school secondary stage was tested from three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of G@@ 9 must be spe@@ eded up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all the grammar schools we want .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal told me that the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which it is known that they can kill , but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last three weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern states , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ho@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were engaged in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal which has been centrally ruled for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted for certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be reconstructed .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 sq@@ .@@ m. area .
a mix of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter plot in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
it is planned to use the grounds for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
which investor in@@ quired is not yet clear .
no contracts have yet been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had acquired a part of the property , which is located on the Ring Road / corner Large Street , already purchased a few months ago and can be demol@@ ished .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the plans for a holiday res@@ ett@@ lement at the Small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time .
quite a few An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sell@@ out of their recreational fu@@ gi@@ um
for months , the closed doors were negotiated , mu@@ stered , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Small Sea close to Em@@ den at the table .
the interested , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ de company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach went on the offensive from the system @-@ construction management : &quot; we have not yet an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea bu@@ d owners who came to the meeting called forth the images and new details on the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member of the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears as many other project critics that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus charging , so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz
what happens exactly on the well @-@ hect@@ are grounds of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the construction plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus tours , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / defic@@ its had been doubled to 11 million $ .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also fled the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya devast@@ ated by the war .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly overweight people with diabetes are longer living with diabetes after weight loss surgery than those receiving non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c smoke - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those who underwent this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease incidence fell completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , in comparison to that of diabetes , the incidence of diabetes was only at one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical treatment group , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish the mortality in five years , thus the guiding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study did not show any advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is cal@@ ming to individuals with a BM@@ I of 35 that are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their body with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject that currently attracts attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to place a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we have to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and revealed that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of ing@@ es@@ tion of hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison@@ ous control centres in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years that swallow strongly alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of in@@ comes from hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the po@@ ison@@ ous control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more and more interested in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children disinf@@ ect@@ ants deliberately drink while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ iny in social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
juven@@ iles have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very attractive to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the K@@ ans@@ as University Hospital , told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p of whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sp@@ lashes of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in school after straw@@ berry , was brought to an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk in an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician , who treated it outside Atlanta in the twin medicine center .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah caught her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the sign of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs nut , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands @-@ off disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health officials suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti @-@ bacterial products all around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ban@@ ished her from her room .
the police regarded the ver@@ ei@@ tel@@ ed plan as &quot; talking &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority .
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
during a rear @-@ end collision between Nordr@@ ing and Her@@ den , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver was easily injured during a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the round@@ about in the direction of the industrial area , and it was too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ torium with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta that was before .
in the accident @-@ related vehicles , damage of approximately 10,000 euros was caused by the police .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ Mittel@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ ger are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic will have to fight , but the Norwegian chef sw@@ or to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now clearly ahead of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel this exactly like this - but we must go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
now standing together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you &apos;ve seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

Hear@@ ts suspended on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent off the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Defender &apos;s Red Card was later lifted - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was re@@ vo@@ iced in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned the integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swear to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was instructed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts via Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident took place in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer and added : &quot; it is safe to say that I &apos;m not returning to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
the Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United has still confidence in the management team to turn things - but admit that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will return the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is glad to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen was desper@@ ately struggling against Hamilton Ac@@ cords in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory giving them a gap of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which games of this kind have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the 5.5 per cent U@@ K@@ s , as shown by the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Bureau ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the first quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken dis@@ rupted the process
since the security staff was unable to satisfy the situation , the employees called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officers could take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adolescents were picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and remained in the custody at first .
why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is held to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours of visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be there to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to contact you .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying from unnecessary death .
man who persu@@ ades the police persecution to come out of the c@@ anning river
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he over@@ spoke the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few metres away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a house peace break @-@ incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of the C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; a good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards trying to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ay for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t swa@@ b test at Li@@ dar , which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; look like too high clusters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had made the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity section had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said to rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reign@@ ing president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the conclusion that it will be personally ?
has the R@@ V@@ L look cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say now makes them think about it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s frustr@@ ations levels have built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching meant he could &quot; throw his license across the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the failed Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; laugh@@ able , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly applied mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was also the case .
but it had it on the race day too .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after the driver &apos;s flight

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against rival because of claims to ring fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as an &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites in the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson declared that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm @-@ player &quot; Ring Games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s coach Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed comment to the Storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy champi@@ oned the squ@@ ad of his team and said that they were only concentrating on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy continued to add that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team vo@@ iced him confi@@ dently , because they worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows up again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when she struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real focus and that has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is strange , as this repeat@@ ed@@ ely appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds one of his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a cra@@ p .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of soccer to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co vs. Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and no points anything exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night in the au@@ fin@@ als in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ b@@ ail after drug delivery
a man who possibly threatened a lifetime penalty for his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America over Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ threatening sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire quantity and that in the cafe would have been out of a harmless background .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ k &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the inqu@@ isi@@ tive explanations of both people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and is holding a cur@@ few at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driving cab breaks apart
during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had braking in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate to the left at the last moment , as the police informed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ maker tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep and logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and aler@@ ted her mother immediately .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; Web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed against the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the search on the computer was done by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ lia .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on her phone she called her mother and was shaking and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the regulations and not appear before court at a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg to not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , because it could be argued that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case Ho@@ gg was granted deposit but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other cases pending .
he was still admitted to the sexual offen@@ ders &apos; directory before the Jud@@ gment Day .
slu@@ gg@@ ish do@@ dge to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are taken away from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the smu@@ g@@ gers caused people from fear of discovery and arrest at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river border river Inn , Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and traffic @-@ guns to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
compared to the start of the week , more refugees gathered at Munich Central Station in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 o &apos;clock , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : off@@ shoots expected by tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against squ@@ ir@@ rels in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area above Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart .
the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was dra@@ gged from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic in recent days .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom of the sea with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass does it : every two years , the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is above all moving among the compact cars that are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations fell to this segment alone in August , according to the Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( September 17 @-@ 27 ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim / Frankfurt . Opel provides an entry below the largest competitor , VW Golf , with a view of 17 650 Euro .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen supply further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA or new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a Com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan publisher wants to find its position in the growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines perfectly adap@@ ts to the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is given by manufacturer &apos;s specifications in 170 New@@ ton@@ meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ers put their hands on the front panel . here , the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was mainly modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and was first integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the pre @-@ folded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are humane
the Federal Constitutional Court issued a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison quarters of Te@@ gel , which had been housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces within a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison quarters between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square feet of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was once again on the open foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his official liability for the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dge raised the verdict of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and returned the case to the trial .
they see the human dignity of the man viol@@ ated .
K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ cht now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of liability for compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ing the protection of the personality would be concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ cht now has to clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was locked naked in a cell .
according to a 2011 decision , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy of human dignity .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to an in@@ decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case for three months between 15 and 21 hours a day .
in the past few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come into the head@@ lines because of missing personnel .
therefore , prisoners are always included 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even ra@@ ckets should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of offspring , 19 are expected to fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vi@@ zek@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accept a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany conve@@ ys the following overview .
according to different forecasts there are between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Buil@@ dings ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - over the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing apartments fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing units would have to be built each year and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to the recognition of labour .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation that limits asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - a majority of the views have prevailed , so that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market more quickly .
lack of knowledge of German is a major obstacle to access to the labour market .
up to now there is no adequate supply of general and occupational language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the creation of networks is the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kinder@@ gar@@ tens , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ren@@ ched parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ alas , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the sen@@ ate administration in Berlin .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ bills in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is increasing due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for instance by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students are prepared without knowledge of German in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ones from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal land asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception hitherto was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
studying willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or d@@ ow@@ ment do not receive benefits according to the asylum application law if they start studying .
the latter generally do not receive af@@ af@@ ood , since they do not fall under the circle of authorized persons .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far to be eligible to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this funding gap needs to be closed , however , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually l@@ essen the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state church law will continue to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic char@@ itable association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representative of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to fight against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to impose such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law into Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also change the majority society , pushing the reduction of discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a decade now an anti @-@ discrimination clause and a general equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series was showing that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the advoc@@ acy groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and which international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ racism convention will commit to Germany must become a reality in the next few years if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far , writes French President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of man@@ power and capacity , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks to susp@@ end health cards to all newcom@@ ers .
these services could later be accounted for by the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to collect as many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum application law prescri@@ bes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , the doctors mainly make the language barriers created .
even so far , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are less informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in hospitals , but also in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es , interpre@@ ters would need to be taken over .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic glance .
for example , there are clearly more un@@ affected disabilities in refugee camps , and the youth deal with HIV .
but with some of the other cases , German doctors would be able to make clear of their education , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so hard to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill , according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
particularly vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fears of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms being chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically sick asylum seekers can apply for psycho@@ therapy in the welfare offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the welfare offices , non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the goal is to draw every age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites to dream on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion , &quot; under this motto , is the current stage production .
for more than 33 years , the Cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for a trav@@ eller is therefore in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km @-@ long tour can now experience this flair .
the Cir@@ cus Programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family catches the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to easily record it .
light@@ ness and flexibility - they identify with these words .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with a sense of intuition and articul@@ ation .
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake people are fascinated and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; explains Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks at her : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is read by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena either .
the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a Zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst looks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or more 200 people , we always do our best and are there with all our heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 : 00 pm to his performances .
on Sunday the program will start at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is the family day , for the performance at 5@@ pm prices are reduced .
in addition , the animals are open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall rapidly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also du@@ sted by alle@@ gations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ ehr@@ inger .
last month they had booked him out and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the Spe@@ aker of Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ as@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the affected parliament members that the immunity ended in the Parliament and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard to reduce up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing enterprise hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job reduction will result in a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and in @-@ depth portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage has been called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely @-@ focused enterprises provide a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says te@@ amm@@ ate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly completed the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is no longer matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognizes , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 league players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight seasons , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 that have suffered most injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s price , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement will continue in the injury rate during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta were allowed to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow players who need it to enjoy a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured by the Richter scale 3.3 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven away from the far hope to lead the club to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ se triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al has never worked .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ ship Festival : the comedy show giving us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove at a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m campaign against a miserable life ) announced the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally @-@ healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation prev@@ ails .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship which affects our mental health much more deeply .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments while watching football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they are often reluct@@ ant to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one speaks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of men friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the phone may also help people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince parking stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , which brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a header at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which held a 2 : 2 draw on the weekend against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who could take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed into Johan Wil@@ and past beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off suggested to reach this stage , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes appeared , with some mis@@ passes and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who , with no less than five attempts , p@@ atz@@ te alone in the first half and then was abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was chann@@ eled by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans won his sixth win after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi witnessed a gate at the end .
the trainer from Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the skill games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern evi@@ dently stood shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona back then .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winners , two times club world champion , twice Europe champion , one time world champion , the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already leaving Barcelona prior to the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Madrid won everything , we nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and also the Bayern Munich .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have gone with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , switched on the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and finally celebrated the King &apos;s leave triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays down variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown ra@@ cked when this stressed the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it in the occupation of the film and not in filling the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian consolidated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the character of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove that is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing rights in the film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was ir@@ radi@@ ated , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after being killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , Michael Brown killed Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s movement and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured restra@@ int .
in February the singer Prince made a recording on the move during the introduction of nominated albums of the year at Gramm@@ y Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still weaker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have released an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition show , which just finished her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
director K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to handle over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad aus@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) beat 6 times in 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three rounds possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen each game , and so I want to go very concentrated into the game .
the design@@ ate Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rounds , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has kept the sleeping ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three rounds in the back at the end of the seventh inner ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ ny , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time this season was held in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ fa hit a Double Play
at the end of the ninth inner ring , Detroit added a high @-@ performance insurance @-@ run , wall created an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , cancelled S@@ ano in three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited from the start of the game by an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the risk list before the game after he had been missing more than one month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes released a single at Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers made a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not hit well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three rounds in six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the age of litter .

hundreds of refugees drow@@ ned in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people involved in it will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden cured on Tuesday night .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this eventu@@ ality over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be accommod@@ ated temporarily .
they will then be distributed to other local authorities .
over the past ten days , according to the government presi@@ dency responsible for the inau@@ g@@ ural address , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German military measures in Syria an option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he presented the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective Weg@@ g@@ out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the Kel@@ ch had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria has also re @-@ established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call for concrete figures and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the strong refugee situation in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this jointly with the countries , announced Chancellor Merkel on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister at the Federal Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection would also complain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany .
this view was strongly shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to cut the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is unlike Serbia on the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from searching for badges on Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said about the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , e@@ ye@@ witness reports reported thousands of migrants on their way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean is sp@@ illing .
this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
according to this , the moon sli@@ ps easily on its orbit around the ring planet .
although this motion of motion is only small , but still too large for a permanently solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) of Tuesday .
the researchers presented their analyses in the form of &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s Saturn in 2006 , causing water vap@@ or and ice particles to feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole it must be an underground sea , closed the astronom@@ ers back then .
the expansion of the hidden ocean , however , was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München , several weeks ago
the 1860 München must do without Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old confirmed an examination of ad@@ duc@@ tors .
R@@ ama had compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich &apos;s Li@@ ons , diagnosis &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a rob@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must now think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n , the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the possible commitment of a non @-@ uni@@ form@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Austrian National player should start running on Thursday already on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured herself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent clas@@ h on her head .

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
the exotic fruits are still healthy : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Pri@@ marily , man@@ goes contain lots of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor to beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone doesn &apos;t tell us how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .

first blow storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz communicated on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night to Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the gro@@ aning valleys .
after fo@@ eh@@ ement on Thursday morning we cross a prominent cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area on the British Is@@ les in a powerful south@@ western current .
on the Alps side the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows until Thursday morning in the conci@@ li@@ atory valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the mountain@@ side .
rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , South of the Alps has to be calculated in the next 48 hours with partly over 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after the last few days big rainf@@ all has already fallen .
on Thursday morning the air dri@@ fts off , as a result a cold front tar@@ ts with a strong , partly thunder@@ ing rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind is refreshing to stor@@ my and the temperatures go back significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it gets sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome has now a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless square in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was requested by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could only live in secret their faith for centuries as a minority .
with the square , it is symbo@@ lically apparent that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he emp@@ tied the city at that time as a welcome sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions , according to historians , should have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then ki@@ cked off the division of the Western Church with his theses on the trade of aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with beautiful pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who , in 150 motifs , has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite ble@@ ak .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt was working on his Bible project for which he made a subj@@ ectively @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that focus on themes like cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and so into today , translated into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original text quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant ruler of the Sovereign Order of Malta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the education happened once with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to rev@@ ise this , in order to be able to bear me again with the Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to make art more important in the quick@@ est time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is characterised by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall down &quot; into the images , let them appear on them , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; ever &quot; to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I am not careful not to fully grasp the Bible , but to choose the most important , even mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and that of responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X run@@ way
plans made , place found , company mand@@ ated to model ground hills for a circular course : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished .
fail@@ ings in politics and administration were responsible for the dr@@ one , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railways .
so hill off , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permission is given in October , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the First To@@ gether Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck is now able to communicate in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commemor@@ ative break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees up to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for a clear sign on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing matters to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss intensively the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be at the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic certainly will play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must put politics .
the German Football Association therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
as early as this weekend , the 36 professionals set a clear sign when they will bear the impression &quot; We can help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left side of the tri@@ cot instead of the usual &quot; Sponsor@@ ship Logo &quot; ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , head of sport Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody is allowed to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can take advantage of our jet power , influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig was talking about a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication game against Hungary this Friday .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large collective work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements in their locations had started their own projects was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will provide 300@@ ,000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already retri@@ eved the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of the SAP Board of Directors loses an eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the Executive Director of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye for several reports .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he had fallen to a water glass after midnight , which he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , was power@@ less , and then dra@@ gged out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we met before the meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully operational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday release ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I always stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

constitutional Complaints ( BvR ) ( Number of result : 21 )
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus were defini@@ tively sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back at the Bundes@@ liga table game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of its pros , fen@@ nel will not only change its regular elf on the R@@ eus location .
he then announced a change to the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of pro@@ gen@@ y Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europe @-@ League games in the future , Tu@@ chel let it open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ebo@@ ding statement by fellow players R@@ eus , that the final appeal for the B@@ V@@ B in the European League must be the goal , keeps Mittel@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl comprehen@@ si@@ bly : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Frankfurt Motor Show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Mobility Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who will also come together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the ministry of transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio .
to test new technology , a test track is currently underway on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the maximum speed limit for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
when automated driving increasingly , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically feasible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not reck@@ on in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surve@@ yed expect to use autonomous cars in the United States by 20@@ 25 , and 33 per cent in the United States .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , this could represent 15 percent in flowing traffic , in traffic jams 45 percent .
good every fourth person would not give the car control under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
from September 25 to October 4 , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Dus@@ sel@@ dorf wants to strike only in singles .
the final decision is to be made latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; said Mr. Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf .
Bol@@ l was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor appointment in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ aster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also lacking , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should focus on this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World @-@ Trans@@ g@@ ist Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the big star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and with it that he was wearing men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ached earlier , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from 18 September at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the scarcely overlooked oeu@@ vre of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed complete artwork for which much effort has been carried out : to fro@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically hired .
the makers , according to the cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , made 14 tonnes of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught himself to throw away fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier had told in Munich .
later on I bought them .
he did not pay the models for his first show of fashion .
they got nothing but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make metres .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers , for example , they continued to work on blankets and curtains .
this is no longer effective today , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en company .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze Mode played a major role , was then pushed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is le@@ aning on past styles , is a growing potential for the contract .
those who do not use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
gran@@ ny P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialty shops and the wholesale market are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays the mass production is produced in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively sold through chains .
in addition , ex@@ porting exports , currently to Russia and the United States .
so there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association is also trying to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been carrying a seal of quality , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball tip .
at the same time , the machine is sti@@ cking small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legend should not be touched , but Disney also dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it &apos;s not about a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl .
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
whoever plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years in Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already strong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI aims to wi@@ den the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups will boost momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border control policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absorb private capital , and over@@ haul of the population report system .
after the statement , a negative list will be created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of great importance as it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on powers transferred to companies and ensure companies decide how to manage their businesses .
the statement also said China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing requirements and simpli@@ fying the application process .
the right of attor@@ neys to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also included Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fishes and thereby en@@ vision consumers with a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ on .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy will be passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as sh@@ arks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
large predat@@ ory fishes are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that , on the basis of the still valid limits , about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller peac@@ efulness @-@ fish , such as car@@ p , are generally so low that they already observe the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in cl@@ oning is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant distra@@ ction that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fishes through the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts especially in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its website with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health endanger@@ ment of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by the coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet the Green Bun@@ ting Members Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of mercury a year , two thirds of the total em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted in March from the paper .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already counted among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
