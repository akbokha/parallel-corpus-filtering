in accordance with this Convention , the Community notices the transfer of core material from the States under the provisions of this Convention , which is subject to the safegu@@ ards under this Convention .
the securing measures pursuant to this Convention are concluded with regard to core material as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this agreement , has assumed responsibility for this .
the organization carries out documents from which any disclosure and , if necessary , re@@ use the securing measures to the existing core material .
if nuclear material , which is subject to securing measures under this agreement , is to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the association agree with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures pursuant to this Convention may be concluded in relation to this material .
II ) that in the course of the non @-@ use of the securing measures , the score will not be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives .
B ) The organisation and community make a provision that the safegu@@ ards provided in this agreement are not applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
as far as possible , the provision is set as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied .
in any case , the safegu@@ ards provided in this agreement are once again applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organization is kept up @-@ to @-@ date on the total amount and composition of the material contained in the State or State concerned , and on any sharing of such material from this state or these states .
this explains its consent as soon as possible ; it extends only on matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural determin@@ ations and agreements for reporting , but does not include endor@@ sement or under sec@@ rec@@ y knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs incurred by each of them in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this Convention .
if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary expenses as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs as long as it has been cleared up beforehand .
the organisation bears in every case the costs of all additional measurements and sample frames that are required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and States shall ensure that the protection of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same manner as applicable to the nationals of the states .
any claim that the community or state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the community or state for damages - except for damages from a nuclear incident - has been asser@@ ted , arising from the implementation of the security measures according to this agreement , is governed in accordance with international law .
after examination of the relevant information submitted by the Director General , the Council shall ensure that the organization is not in a position to verify that no core material , which must be subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , shall reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged there .
in such steps , the Council , in which mass was acquired by the applied security measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
on request of the organization , community or state , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement .
the Community and States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council encourages the Community and the State concerned to take part in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes , a statement issued by the Council on Article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council shall be disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement and which are not agreed in the negotiation way or by another by the organization , community and the states agreed upon by a party of arbitr@@ ators consisting of five arbitr@@ ators .
the Community and States appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also called two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named will elect a fifth arbitr@@ ator who will lead the presi@@ dency .
if the Community and States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within three or thirty days after the request for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization shall seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure is to apply if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within three or thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organization , the community and the countries concerned .

the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol .
the purpose of this part of the agreement is to specify the procedure required when implementing the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the hed@@ ging measures established in this agreement is the timely discovery of the extraction of significant amounts of core material of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence of such a reduction by the risk of early detection .
in order to obtain the objective stipul@@ ated in Article 28 , the material book@@ keeping is used as a safeguard measure of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the audit by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material that is un@@ allocated for each material balance zone is specified , indicating the limits of accuracy for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization makes after Article 3 full use of the security system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the core material community in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their securing measures , the Community will make use of the procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as it is necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more detailed and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system for the determination of quantities of preserved , produced , failed , lost or otherwise from the stock removed core material and stock quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) Proced@@ ure for assessing accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a report and reporting system that identifies the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock , including the one and out of the material balance zone ;
g ) provisions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures pursuant to this agreement do not extend to material in the mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ ally containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel circulation , entered into the states , shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on core material that is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ al enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured , or if this core material or other material manufactured in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit is imported into the States , so it is subject to the other safegu@@ ards mentioned in this agreement .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this agreement are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the community is of the opinion that the recovery of core material , which is subject to securing measures under this agreement , is temporarily not possible or desirable , so consult the organization and the community on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The hed@@ ging measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organization exemp@@ ts the following core material from the securing measures following this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material , if it is used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organization exemp@@ ts nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this agreement , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total amount of material delivered in the States is no more than the case at any time .
a ) a total of one kilogra@@ m of special fol@@ dable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ;
a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if freed core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures under this agreement , precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective con@@ serving of the tasks of the organization under this agreement , in the individual as to how the procedures established in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements may be extended or changed without alter@@ ing the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement into force . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements may enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
the organization , based on the initial report cited in Article 62 , provides a summary inventory of all the core material underlying this agreement in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other .
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ ent@@ ment problems .
C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has submitted a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria established in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; special transactions account , &quot; which consists of the funds which the Member States shall contribute in accordance with this Agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is managed and used by the organization as the administrator ( in this property ) only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ solvency notes of the member state , which are to be paid on request in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and deposited at the organisation &apos;s h@@ ind point in the country concerned .
B ) Payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator at an agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the residual amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into account the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may , on the request , make payments before the above mentioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportion@@ ate draws on the cash or the school j@@ ars to cover the expenses for the special loans and balance the special transaction account appropriately .
when granting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the terms of the E@@ EC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ advantageous ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) regardless of whether or not it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan program , assessed , approved and administr@@ ated , under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction account may not be used in lieu of ordinary funds issued by the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization that is bound by a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of entry into force .
apart from section 4 , special loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which apply in general to the organization provided by the organization ; they are therefore re@@ payable in 50 years each in ten years of free years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the member states and are re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
amounts for payment of this bid must be paid directly to the organization it retains .
each special loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is given in particular .
the recei@@ pts from any special loans can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be recipients of a special transaction loan at the time of loan granted .
capital re@@ payments from a special transaction loan shall be transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in this manner in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until full publication of all the special loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors in preparation and about the plans and programs approved by the directors .
during the period of withdrawal of the special loan contract , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC a quarterly basis on the development of the special loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the administrator noti@@ fies the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization on this account closure .
after full payment of the special loan , the administrator of the EW@@ G transfers as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and conduc@@ ts appropriate recordings and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid out of the account recei@@ pts , the amounts paid to the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the full issue of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or plans financed by special transactions or on all other issues relating to the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the E@@ EC and the organisation have not entered into force , the agreement and all arising obligations of the parties are due with immediate effect .
if the entire capital amount of all the special loans taken from the bene@@ fici@@ aries in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to Member States , this agreement and all arising obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States note the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedure in question .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat publishes these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement will be effective and will enter into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two copies in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each word being equally binding .

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements Directive on the mobili@@ zation of member states &apos; demands in the medium term financial advisory board
the BI@@ S could close Stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ Z would be ready .
with each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially take over a commitment for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ ables , without the fact that a total of five years is exceeded .
at the opening of the loans , as well as for their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws will not be made before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time that would be taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those applied to the BI@@ S at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds on the market themselves , the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum , corresponding to the corresponding margin increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to tell me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on the trade with mut@@ ton and lamb
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of sheep and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are passed over as follows :
- fresh or cooled hammer , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the quantity of the agreed amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the offer form is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned below , in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community demands protection clause , it obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the Community market regulated in this agreement is not affected .
in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the remainder of the year .
the Community comm@@ its to limit exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
when new Member States are joined , the Community will change the amount of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade under number 2 in accordance with the amount of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this will be taken into account under the number 5 ho@@ ist@@ ing rate of the creation .
the total amount mentioned under Number 2 is set with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could compromise the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an hammer and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention stands on frozen meat is not under@@ mining the sales of Argent@@ ine Hamm@@ el and lamb meat due to the regulation of the regulation .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of sheep and lamb , as well as for slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs , is only at prices and conditions that are consistent with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of world trade with these products .
these terms are interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of the Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the general customs and trade agreement .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that there are export lic@@ ences set out in this agreement for the products listed under Number 1 .
in its turn , the Community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent upon the submission of an export license , which is issued by the representative designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way that the placement of the import license for the goods in question cannot be wai@@ ved .
regulations also stipul@@ ate that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals informs the amounts that have been issued for export lic@@ ences ; these details may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and operates smoothly .
it regularly reviews the Ten@@ dency of the Hamm@@ el - , Lamb and Go@@ at Market of the two parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including conditions that are of importance for the target number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goats must be carried out under the agreement not mentioned in the agreement .
the committee discusses all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions of this agreement apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number 2 fixed annual amount applies to the time from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount due to the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual amount and accounts for the seasonal character of the trade .
this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and in the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform your government about this .
I honor to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of sheep and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the use of the common market organisation for sheep and goats &quot; meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the quantity of the agreed amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed in accordance with the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the remainder of the year .
the Community comm@@ its to limit exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about the trade with mut@@ ton , lamb and goat meat
I honor me to refer to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand into the community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for mut@@ ton , lamb and goat meat .
recognizing the fact that sheep farming and export of sheep and lamb are exist@@ ential after the world market , and in particular after the community for New Zealand &apos;s economy , and that the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s hammer and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honor the following convention :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled hammer , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
according to this agreement New Zealand will ensure Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat access to the Community market in the amount established in the agreement .
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal he@@ el of its hammer and lamb is not affected by the application of the Regulation .
in order to ensure a flaw@@ less operation of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the quantity of the annual amount actually exceeded the set amount does not exceed the set amount .
the quantities fixed below are executed in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community ass@@ ures New Zealand that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position in the community &apos;s market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a change in the offer form is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee referred to in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community demands protection clause , it ple@@ dges to protect the interests of New Zealand resulting from this agreement .
in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed amounts , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand will change the quantities stipul@@ ated in Cl@@ ause 2 according to the extent of New Zealand &apos;s trade with each new Member State .
the import burdens of these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account in the clause 5 referred to in clause 5 .
the total amount mentioned in clause 2 is set with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could compromise the normal sales of New Zealand Hamm@@ el and lamb meat on the communal market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions , so that the sale of intervention stands on frozen meat is not under@@ mined because of the implementation of the ordin@@ ance .

a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance shown on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appearances may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be tested on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated solely by volume of the blood cell floo@@ ding in the total volume .
in the case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination of international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are developed at present .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ und@@ ations .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final blend of a series in which a micro@@ scopic ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination available for the International standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as incomplete Anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown agent in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .

the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation attempts ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight , if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) can be added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the conditions for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein per ml of fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .

the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange for blood group determination should not be colored as artificial as possible , at least as long as it is not until an international agreement reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used , if necessary , to carry out the effectiveness tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages and controls of re@@ agents to determine blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents issued are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it is likely to be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and preservation of the re@@ agent &apos;s stability .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective part in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
a black on white printed label in English and French can be fixed on every single container , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
