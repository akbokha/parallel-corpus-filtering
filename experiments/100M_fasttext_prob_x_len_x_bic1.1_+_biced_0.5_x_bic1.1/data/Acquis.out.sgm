<seg id="10">2. the list of raw materials produced in the Community section will be revised periodically according to the following modalities:</seg>
<seg id="11">A) The application for the inclusion of new raw materials in the list is directed by the associations of the watchmaking industry of the community or by the manufacturers of raw materials established in the community to the Swiss watch chamber. the request is to add a technical description of the raw material caliber.</seg>

<seg id="14">B) The withdrawal from the list of raw materials listed in the list shall be communicated by the associations of the watchmaking industry of the Community or from the manufacturer who requested the reception beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="15">C) If the requirements of the legal technical control in Switzerland are not fulfilled, the Swiss watch chamber can demand the cancellation of the relevant raw materials from the list; it teaches the affected party from this.</seg>
<seg id="16">If this does not agree, it may take up the procedure in accordance with paragraph 3 within two months.</seg>

<seg id="21">After checking these games according to the standards of legal technical control in Switzerland, the institutions compare their results and create a joint report for the Mixed Commission with their conclusions and their eventual proposals.</seg>
<seg id="22">The agreement and the list attached to him are published in the official publication organ of the contracting parties and communicated to watch manufacturers by the relevant professional associations.</seg>
<seg id="23">At least every three years, counting on the entry into force of the agreement, the Mixed Commission takes a redesign of the list, in order to take account of the now made entries and matches.</seg>
<seg id="24">The agreement will come into force on 1 January 1973, unless the ratification documents have been exchanged until this time.</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may, on the request, make payments before the above mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportionate draws on the cash or the school jars to cover the expenses for the special loans and balance the special transaction account appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the terms of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without disadvantageous; and</seg>

<seg id="751">The receipts from any special loans can be used for expenditures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or provided in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be recipients of a special transaction loan at the time of loan granted.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from a special transaction loan shall be transferred to the special transaction account, and the amount refunded in this manner in the currency of a member state is to be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full publication of all the special loans, the caretaker will instruct the EEC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors in preparation and about the plans and programs approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of withdrawal of the special loan contract, the caretaker teaches the EEC a quarterly basis on the development of the special loans and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator notifies the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external auditor of the organization on this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special loan, the administrator of the EWG transfers as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
