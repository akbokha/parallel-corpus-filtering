it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ y thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder where patients have regular episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic up@@ setting ) alternating with periods of normal sen@@ timent .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased agitation or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral consumption of the medication is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or the enam@@ el tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients taking other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l presumably appears primarily as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l acts as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the brain activity , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic drug ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution for taking up .
in the two trials with the injection solution , patients receiving Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in reducing the symptoms of increased anxiety than patients receiving a placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo .
in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo for the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for inhal@@ ation ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( controlled shr@@ ink@@ age ) , acute ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , nausea , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ weigh the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate to out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy across the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although single patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient population , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ sight disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ ot@@ eric and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or to break down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be deposited .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to coma @-@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sion@@ ers .
considering the common application of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefit should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as iso@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ e- reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be attributed with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ an / 3 @-@ method xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ph ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
due to the insufficient data storage for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal &apos;s reproductive studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total less incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Parkinson &apos;s , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without cause of death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is of benefit in the treatment of an over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in are medi@@ ated on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
with the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in dos@@ ages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy subjects , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C ra@@ cl@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ ative .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 of the respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ k @-@ Depres@@ sion@@ aire scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a placebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in a superior efficacy in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a superior outcome in the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline in the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination rule is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isers about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences in the eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
a single dose study in subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no significance for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 3 to 10@@ times the mean Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy metabol@@ ites from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the concentrations found in the study were not more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in are medi@@ ated on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and commen@@ ced with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines applied to conservation or ac@@ utely @-@ therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ sight disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ ot@@ eric and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combination @-@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared with the single dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ off dose intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and that at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .

the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .

a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of as@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ ham reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline value on P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 per cent of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in a superior efficacy in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a superior outcome in the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline in the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection is 90 % greater than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tra @-@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety relevant concerns arose after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15 ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; this means they have limited or no significance for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in case of female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy metabol@@ ites from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mid @-@ steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to that of a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel dispens@@ er ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
if one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in the efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing the disease and survival between the drugs .
in contrast to these indicators , patients who had previously received other treatments for metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the start of treatment .
the CH@@ MP ( CH@@ MP ) Committee stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel contained drugs and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel in order to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placement of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ oden@@ um &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached to Grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were performed and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have essentially different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be stopped immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in patients no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number is again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there is nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age that do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised before treatment via sperm conservation , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to operate machinery .
listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 lists the side effects that have occurred in combination with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 000 ) .
occasional : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue @-@ burn , dry mouth , tooth@@ ed gum , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , ul@@ cers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the thor@@ ax wall , weakness of the muscles , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness . very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in connection case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a timi@@ pri@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the co@@ ag@@ glomer@@ ation of micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ zy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour is performed due to the alb@@ umin@@ bi protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ret@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two @-@ arm un@@ blin@@ ded studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks , either in the form of a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are presented below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for abl@@ ation at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous injection of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase way .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the large distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel within a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane injection ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine elimination was 4 % of the total total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data were available for patients over 75 years of age , because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ light protection for over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , caution should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

member states must ensure that the holder of the approval for placing on the market before the market launch provides medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing supplement . • With un@@ ambig@@ uous depic@@ tion of the correct application of the product , equipped refrigerator boxes for transport by the patient .
this means that it is similar to a biological medicinal product approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with diseases indicated by the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ y@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or by the fact that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the course of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , Ab@@ y@@ amed was compared to the reference medicinal product .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to either se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of inj@@ ected inter@@ sec@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients being re@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ y@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ y@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union it was proved that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ y@@ amed will provide information packages for medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the placing of sec@@ t@@ amed throughout the European Union .

the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large amount of blood ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ y@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is to be expected .
H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or programme .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; hence , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition is required by the physician .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or under the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in light of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the durable hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose can be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for an@@ a@@ emia control and an@@ a@@ emia .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired finish is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; hence , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition is required by the physician .
in light of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for controlling the symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l versus the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the prec@@ is@@ cu@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l versus the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ tations is required should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the onset of the Ab@@ y@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively present 300 I.@@ U. / kg in 10 consecutive days , on the day of the procedure and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic boiling sal@@ ine to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin on a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive any se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients who are provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or programme , the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , adju@@ v@@ ant or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported about the appearance of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of efficacy , defined as a reduction in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the toxic tendency should be determined and the common causes of non @-@ response ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ escence @-@ toxic@@ ation , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the reci@@ pro@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the reproductive @-@ cy@@ te &quot; index ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ litres or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of inter@@ sec@@ amed patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration specified in Section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by concentration on the control of an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumor patients receiving chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be studied and treated accordingly before the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy begins .
patients who undergo a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate pro@@ phyla@@ xis since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa can be an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events for patients with an initial po@@ ole value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose can be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies of tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
via th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events like m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ cal isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ ms , ret@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , so also patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common adverse effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and , in relation to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , is identical to endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ thro@@ po@@ genic patients .
it could be demonstrated by means of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression @-@ progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed an un@@ clari@@ fied , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality rate than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin patients and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value under 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved by intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the final gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years ago , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) .
14 in animal experimental studies of approximately 20 times the recommended weekly dose recommended by humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to dimin@@ ished local body weight , dela@@ ying the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports rely on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and installed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application is established and functional before the medicine is put into circulation and as long as the medicine is used in the traffic .
the owner of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as described in version 5 of the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time as the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management System for medicinal products for human use .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • in receiving new information that could affect the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures , within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones .
• Have a heart attack or a stroke within a month before your treatment - if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) • the risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) exists - if , for example , such a blood graf@@ ting has occurred .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial vascular disease ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the carot@@ id ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed it may occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ acts in further treatment .
your doctor may need regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before the onset of the treatment with ab@@ sc@@ amed .
very rarely has been reported about the appearance of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( spra@@ yed under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ blast block@@ en@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with the Ab@@ y@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is treated best .
therefore , Ab@@ y@@ amed has to be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or the blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with the Ab@@ y@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion mark due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ s@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ y@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your blood @-@ color@@ ant values ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your fl@@ y@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that ab@@ sec@@ amed will act as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumour in certain circumstances .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be studied and treated accordingly before the start of treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed .
if your blood @-@ color@@ ant ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) values are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ y@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken / applied other medicines or used it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedy for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are resources for the development of the immune system , for example for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will need regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ y@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will need regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a given value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash the stre@@ amed yourself under the skin .

ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a minor trauma hip frac@@ ture as with the eye disease ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
to treat the disease Pa@@ get may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ t@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of frac@@ tures and hip frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Pa@@ get , Ac@@ t@@ sta was tested in two trials to 3@@ 57 patients and compared with the Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis patients ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis patients ) , the risk of frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with acet@@ oni@@ ze are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( the death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Ac@@ p@@ sta &apos;s manufacturer provides clari@@ fication material for doctors who prescri@@ be acet@@ oni@@ ze for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to apply the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tract contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing care
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Pa@@ get , Ac@@ p@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get .
after treatment of Pa@@ get with Ac@@ ci@@ sta a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen briefly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ t@@ sta is not recommended as there are limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data for safety and efficacy is missing .
ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
prior to the onset of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta , an existing hypo@@ cr@@ emia should be treated with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ ther@@ mia can develop , the maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be treated with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
no data is available for patients who require dental treatment , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen briefly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 from 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al dysfunction associated with ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were similar in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the Plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine in 10 days of the application was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received supplementary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the disease patho@@ gen@@ esis ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recently developed hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion station , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw region ) that have been treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including c@@ annab@@ ino@@ id acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients responded to oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and in a patient treated with placebo .
in the case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ c@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by adding or@@ ally calcium and / or an IV in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ H@@ as ≤ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
acet@@ oni@@ o @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on ac@@ la@@ sta hip frac@@ tures showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ ci@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ment of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the lower spine by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) one year after the third annual dose bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vis .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture compared with placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C telep@@ hon@@ ic ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were measured in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
after 12 months , B@@ SAP was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was maintained at 28 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below bas@@ eline after 12 months and was maintained at 52 % below bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was maintained at 55 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all points of time .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to placebo for an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on the overall half and by 4.3 % at the lower half .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT trial , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ ci@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once annual dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior compared to once weekly gift of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate to the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ ac@@ tin was examined in patients and patients over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moderate acute morph@@ ology Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ t@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at will be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma levels decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearances from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination of exclusion with a terminal exclusion period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above and ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total @-@ body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts irrespective of the dose : 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in the rate of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of the met@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 patients examined .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction until down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid requires .
as for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ a- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest intraven@@ ous , intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and a body weight of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg in rats .
in trials of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C mean 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as on the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most common finding in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metaph@@ or of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages ranging from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum @-@ calcium levels .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medical devices , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . • At the request of the E@@ MEA .
z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get disease .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
at the Pa@@ get disease , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and gives the bone strength again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ t@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied even if it is not prescription medicines .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to harm the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and beverages , please be sure to take sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta according to your doctor &apos;s instructions .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ t@@ sta works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ t@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if you miss the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , immediately contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before stopping the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta in case you are considering the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the in@@ fu@@ sions followed .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
at present it is unclear whether Ac@@ ac@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have such symptoms with you after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
an allergic reaction , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue , or throat ) was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the mentioned side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture is recommended to use ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion for two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , the patient must be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is especially important for patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ COMP@@ LIA is also applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
in addition , four studies were carried out to more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting the room in comparison with a placebo .
the studies on the setting of smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess in this area of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA ? the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LIA that were observed during studies ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , provoke a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .
caution is advised while using A@@ COMP@@ LIA with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

he added to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , who have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ COMP@@ LIA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
it is also possible for patients who , in addition to obesity , have no recogn@@ is@@ able risks , may experience depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other close relatives ( relatives or other loved ones ) should point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The effectiveness and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant during treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . l@@ n

5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for safety of the following adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic range , were considered to be potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions appears to be associated with proced@@ ural stress like dealing with the animals .
when Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycle disturbances .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exhibition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation resulted in no changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Auth@@ ori@@ zation Report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the acet@@ ate treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level falls , making type 2 diabetes more difficult to adjust .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced when applying the dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ one and a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin decreased H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who also took placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ theses ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to approve Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are threatened by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserves .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme parameters can be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme parameters are to be checked .
the decision whether to continue the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be guided by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
hem@@ odi@@ lution is a minor reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ isons @-@ controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral double or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch was reported under treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report on disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparable medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparable medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or does this , treatment should be cancelled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel block@@ ers and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting from pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 1000 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the lens and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents were equal to three times the upper limit of the normal range , compared to placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups treated with compar@@ isons .
in the Pro@@ Active study , which lasted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparable medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to have a activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , resulting in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it has been shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is om@@ itted ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and a slight but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was found under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while values dimin@@ ished under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in a 20 @-@ week study , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
according to oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is resor@@ bed quickly , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to the efficacy in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies proved that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the F@@ ä@@ ces ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metabol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys appeared in accordance with repeated ad@@ minist@@ ering plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the insulin resistance resulting from the gest@@ ation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thus reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ones resulted in increased frequency of col@@ onic tumours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparable medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparable medication .
in another study , over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a 20 @-@ week study , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was enrolled in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to effectively utilize the insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been similar to other human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the packing supplement ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane on the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a fast initial action along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy can change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin @-@ origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account the possible interactions during the therapy and always ask his patients for other medications taken from them .

however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving loss of consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an un@@ diagnosed aid or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the physician .
the effect begins within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption Profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with a fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id doses may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the place of administration Occ@@ a@@ sion@@ ally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non@@ diabe@@ tic patients ( blood sugar 4,@@ 4 - 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who are already showing signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or rheum@@ atic no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ ate deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment there may still be rheum@@ atic attacks ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take other medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , since it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year in 7@@ 62 patients .
in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who took 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular in patients suffering from heart problems in pre @-@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood was more effective than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ at@@ ab@@ ase ( including a medical history known or currently present , and / or rheum@@ atism ) .
if the serum urine acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and youths Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t receivers , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or un@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other res@@ inous medicines , acute rheum@@ atism can occur during the treatment period because the lowering of serum resin levels may initially mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
for example , in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine often increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies , mild symptoms of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ or and in the subsequent course ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ wasn &apos;t have any interactions with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ hibition can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ ll level ( a blocking of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous addition of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and n@@ apro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) was associated .
in clinical trials , the use of n@@ apro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a 32 % decrease in C@@ MA@@ x , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect its performance .
a num@@ eri@@ cally higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ory group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors determined by these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could be observed in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which have been reported in all f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated simultaneously with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no serious r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment groups and were reported to patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or at a lower frequency :

lowering serum levels of serum to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and continued throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function of the AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( ie . ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum resin concentration in subjects , despite their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against g@@ out in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients did not need any treatment against g@@ inning ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of the patients &apos; complete disappearance until month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ ie / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration are easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentration , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent flow state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who exclusively took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive tract , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhea ( diar@@ rhea ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing ) , ham@@ pered abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic b@@ umping .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components .
it may not be used in case of diseases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising the day . • Pati@@ ents are not to ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , since there is no risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cers , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , are given only under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as o@@ es@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ c , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and requiring hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all the signs and symptoms that indicate possible reactions , and patients should be advised to stop the medicine in case of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al heart@@ burn or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn .
3 . the risk of severe adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue to take symptoms following an o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a ( after market launch ) , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men mainly admini@@ ster intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available that indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment is reduced in patients who require a max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial surgery to reduce the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women only and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports were reported by cancer patients , however , oste@@ opor@@ osis was also reported .
nevertheless , the serum @-@ calcium levels up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar rates .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose may cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6,@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the evidence of the BM@@ D of the spine and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate &apos;s daily use decreased by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
following an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after a night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically important change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distri@@ butions of rats revealed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily divided into soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but is then quickly divided into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous injection of a single dose of 14@@ C Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .
following intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance exceeded 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is affected by these transport systems .

characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
for this reason , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients , which have been transplan@@ ted to kidney or liver in order to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ms are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ms as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation where the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were performed and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used .
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs are taken together with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; con@@ stell@@ ations of the formulation or of the regime should only be undertaken under the closely mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
following a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after change@@ over .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure measured as a tal@@ low level was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate night prim@@ ate phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clear@@ ance substance , adjusting the dose can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patient does not allow oral ing@@ es@@ tion of medicines during the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application For the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ ant therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change after the transplan@@ t is stabil@@ ised .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ ant therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted from 2 daily doses of Progra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , in relation to the entire daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation is to begin with the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ectal transplan@@ t patients , was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in case of pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood tal@@ lies in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in@@ takes and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of full @-@ blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low @-@ level control .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
even after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dosage adjustment , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of the tal@@ low in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the ageing levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood usually stem from 5 - 20 ng / ml and transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur due to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub @-@ exposure or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; con@@ stell@@ ations of the formulation or of the regime should only be undertaken under the closely mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 In order to treat adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f is available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients .
due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , taking herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies can be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea a particularly careful observation of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Progra@@ f a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ ass , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contained , special caution is required in patients with rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with anti@@ fung@@ al drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism is impaired .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the level of hormone exposition , decisions concerning contrac@@ ep@@ tive actions are particularly careful .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduces the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy does not exist .
in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side @-@ effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not exactly determined due to the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects are listed below in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( not inv@@ alu@@ able on the basis of available data ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As is well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ idal ) .
cases of non @-@ virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be conveyed through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell nucle@@ us .
this leads to cal@@ ci@@ ally dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 patients transplan@@ t patients , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases .
overall , the safety profile of oral Progra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the large studies where Progra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent , multi@@ center study with oral Progra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported to receive either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis &apos;s ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 2@@ 1,7 % of cases the cases of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis in ob@@ liter@@ ans were compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients being converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis &apos;s ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ center study with oral Progra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients undergoing a pancre@@ as and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ized trial of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired tal@@ low level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .

factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism brought about by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids shall be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after transplantation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed almost entirely before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs through the bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than Progra@@ f in stable patients ( once daily ) on Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
21 In order to treat adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one due to the lack of Factor VI@@ II conditional , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ rates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new bleeding episodes marked &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the place and the extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment course , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , reach different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding with a proper dose is not ruled out , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered .
the rate of administration should be directed at the patient &apos;s notice , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk is greatest within the first 20 days of exposure and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ posi@@ tional days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic inhibit@@ ors development , re@@ combin@@ ant inhibit@@ ors were observed after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the use of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s , which occur in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , who showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ ke occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma as well as the clearing @-@ rate showed again sufficient values on the 15 postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E .
furthermore , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) was diagnosed after previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients from a ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ tre against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a sustained peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but there were no signs or symptoms that indicated an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to assess the benefit @-@ risk weighing as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for approval for the transport of adv@@ ec@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connect and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumors and thus allow cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who entered Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the review of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ec@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours benefits patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notify the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nose path@@ ways caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) are cl@@ ung .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reli@@ eved on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when examining all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , ti@@ redness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c substances or lau@@ com@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines for treating allergies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from an angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary tract ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hypertension ) or have a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is generally swal@@ lowed ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application should be as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have dissip@@ ated .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after decreasing the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks of termination of such a therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a which can be attributed to phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data were not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment should be de@@ posed in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache ) .
patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze has a minimum of 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions were observed or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor study showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether or not lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins are .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ ae during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with potential le@@ thal processes .
headache , anxiety , difficult Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness , increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vomiting , prec@@ ep@@ id pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il star@@ re and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ations , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the release of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ a as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in an adult single dose study , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not have any influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight track including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years aged between 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze for healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equivalent of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the all@@ otted application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lau@@ rel / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine which is contained in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer leading to nar@@ rowing of the stomach , small intest@@ ine or o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the patient &apos;s history ( short@@ ness of breath due to a cra@@ mp of the lung muscles ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases under the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : high blood pressure • Heart chase , heart beat • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches .
when taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicines .
when applying at the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze conduc@@ ts di@@ zz@@ iness or decreases attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform you immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , neck pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disturbances , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the launch of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely reported on cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disturbances , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspic@@ uous liver @-@ values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ zer for inser@@ ting ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 ml .
A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who had also asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the loops , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes sy@@ rup , the solution for the intake and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of ap@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in the two trials in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptoms of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the present disease progression and can be stopped after the symptoms have passed and resum@@ ed .
patients with persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should be informed , however , that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with ap@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients of 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) .
this includes both the release of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ a as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses that were administered at a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself .
in a single dose study involving adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight track , including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the onset of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire to improve the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was sub@@ stituted for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , despite the eti@@ ology of different forms , is similar and can be recru@@ ited to chron@@ ically patients .
since hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all types of ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected that besides the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , this will lead to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ valence and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
in vi@@ vo , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins are .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are available which support an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that can be fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed is identical to that of children who normally metabol@@ ise .
this drug contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption , or su@@ cro@@ se in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as with the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between 1 and 11 years of age , who came into question for anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily allowance of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not affected by psych@@ om@@ ot@@ oric in adults and adolescents in clinical trials .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not lead to an increase in alcohol @-@ induced power impairment or increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire to improve quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ valence and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ale half @-@ life time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ in@@ bottles with a child @-@ safe polypropylene closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported on the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day for 14 days .

there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the dis@@ or@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
at the recommended dosage , the A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ zer for det@@ ecting for@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant clinical study of multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was used in a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in an adult single dose study , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight track , including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was similar to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian patients ( adults 2 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ zer for inser@@ ting , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 years .

the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
in infants aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , a one @-@ off dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution was observed not to detect any side effects in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 .
in the recommended dos@@ ages , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed .

97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for inser@@ ting is available in bottles with child @-@ safe closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml pack size is a measuring spoon or application sy@@ ringe for use with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml cans .
in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially informed the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company is accepting its application for A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s permission to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a pan@@ de@@ mic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from man to person , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and makes antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane man@@ ure of the virus was dis@@ soci@@ ated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , and is used as a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data basis for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your attending doctor .
if you want more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for dispos@@ ing , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the physician has checked out which anti@@ viral drug the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood of having the virus to respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice a day 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ a depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
however , AIDS cannot cure AIDS , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases related to AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alter@@ ation of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drugs called Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which were resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger viral load after four weeks than in patients who took their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vomiting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients who take St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines which are degra@@ ded as well as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( the death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by a relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years have out@@ weigh the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ gie ) , higher doses should be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous use should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on these medicines .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function , including chronic active hepatitis , show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking these drugs at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four and should be used with care in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cos@@ a is involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , which were necessary for their therapy to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of the introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) , leading to serious clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given along with medicines whose agents are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in an attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse reactions were often observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , to check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was reduced by 30 % .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day were used , proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study to use A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the ant@@ acids component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the proceeds of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ virus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution must be advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ a@@ virus .
the simultaneous addition of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin caused a rise in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase of side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dosage , although no clinical data are available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase of C@@ MA@@ x by K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may interact if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly interact with interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids do not be taken at the same time as ag@@ gra@@ ase as it can cause resor@@ ption problems .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants which are known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous addition of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are to be expected at the same time .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these pharmaceuticals with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic levels to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while offering Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with an or@@ ally recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am while simultaneously applying A@@ gener@@ ase .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons currently no recommendation can be given , as the Am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose is to be adjusted when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous addition of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as ap@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful balancing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in milk lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight during lac@@ tation .
further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most adverse events associated with A@@ gener@@ ase were mild to moderate severity , rose early and rarely lead to treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fat sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ al fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated people who were treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine for a medi@@ an duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( stit@@ ches ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients treated with 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s compared to 27 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ e@@ pap@@ ules nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; one exception formed increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were treated very frequently in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral gene and ga@@ g pol@@ - poly@@ protein levels with the result of an un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans has not yet been defined .
treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral treated patients with the currently registered Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were rarely observed - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred 48 hours , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 included patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M /
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genes associated with reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Resist@@ enz@@ pf@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus @-@ containing schema failed ( one of them showed a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) and animal pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s efficacy in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which treated with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ inter@@ layer threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children between 2 and 18 years of age , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase solution was tested twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
19 Based on this data , the potential benefit of &quot; un@@ brid@@ ged &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children with PI pre @-@ treated children .
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent volume of distribution amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and indicates a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r representing the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components varies during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 therefore need to be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regi@@ mens lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels similar to those who are achieved twice a day after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous ad@@ minist@@ ering of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in doses of 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after two daily application of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ations test , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymph@@ oma , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proved in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to humans , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ju@@ g@@ gling and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ gie ) , higher doses should be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with weak or slight h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cos@@ a is involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was reduced by 30 % .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution must be advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ a@@ virus .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dosage is 31 , although no clinical data are available for this purpose .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous addition of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous ad@@ minist@@ ering Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ mine of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful balancing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for the fo@@ etus .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the potential benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children with PI pre @-@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components varies during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 therefore need to be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in the case of dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after two daily application of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ations test , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymph@@ oma , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young the metabolism channels are not yet fully mature , leaving Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for dispos@@ ing is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting was not documented in patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients or with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for the intake and low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution for infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent risk 47 of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cos@@ a is involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was reduced by 30 % .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , a significantly higher plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us on the prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ l contained in pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
in milk lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished 55 body weight during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral treated patients with the currently registered Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were rarely observed - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
62 Based on this data , the potential benefit of &quot; un@@ brid@@ ged &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children with PI pre @-@ treated children .
the apparent volume of distribution amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and indicates a large volume of ve@@ al volume and an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is applied five times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
the cream is thin@@ ly applied to the affected areas of the skin before bed@@ time so that it remains on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated nip@@ ples . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo had to be applied either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials to a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream is to continue until all visible feet are gone in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if follow @-@ up 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed , a different therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in a thin layer and rub in the clean@@ sed , infected skin area until the cream is fully dra@@ ined .
there should be a balance between the benefits of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balance between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a kn@@ itted to be circumcised were observed .
an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation persi@@ sted , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections applied to the treatment of external genital and perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis treatments , no clinical experience has yet been available .
limited data suggest an increased rate of in@@ clin@@ atory reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group with regard to the removal of the ti@@ lt war@@ ts .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin for about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the use of previously untreated tumours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) , there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute kerat@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally decrease in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after sett@@ ling the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study reveals that patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream should be used with care in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not produce any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) are not achieved after one @-@ off or more topical application , no recommendation can be given to use during lac@@ tation .
the most commonly shared and considered prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions to the site of the treatment of the in@@ clin@@ ically treated patients ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and considered prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the Bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated by 185 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side @-@ effects .
the most common adverse event associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème was in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme were listed below .
this review provided by the study plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials , with three @-@ week treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , it often results in local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ori@@ ation / sli@@ pping / sc@@ rap@@ ing ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) .
according to the review plan , the evaluation of clinical signs showed that in these studies , with five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème , severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and heavy shr@@ ink@@ age and til@@ lage ( 19 % ) came .
in clinical trials investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental one @-@ off oral absorption of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical study , systemic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that the efficacy of a complete healing of the in@@ clin@@ ations in I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior .
60 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine at five times a week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tumours were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super @-@ cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and remained for 48 months .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or on the face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indication extern@@ als , acute ker@@ ato@@ sis and hyper@@ modified bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was investigated in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or weeks ) .
a minimum systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in the three @-@ week @-@ weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s resor@@ ption was low after topical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study of the current application , which was carried out for four months , did not result in similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumors at the application site .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure .
the tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the drug @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

the study mainly examined the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect on the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of aging in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , spinal pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of heat , fever , and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be disclosed every year and if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , egg stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , up to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect associated with in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a suitable clinical environment where recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the phase III clinical trial , almost all Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as there is little experience in the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , cau@@ ti@@ ously , due to the theoretically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction , it is necessary to proceed cau@@ ti@@ ously after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment .
treat 60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ es ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment should be considered with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular up@@ take of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical trials were mainly due to in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older for a duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ s and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable Drug Re@@ perc@@ ussions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients under 5 years , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients had a ser@@ o@@ conversion in 3 months after the start of the treatment , with a more severe form of follow @-@ up in patients under the age of 5 ( average after 26 days vs. 45 days for patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to early retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no antibodies ( R@@ IP ) for det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients with which it had never been a ser@@ o@@ conversion .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , the most prob@@ able about man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire range of diseases , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for a further 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of treatment , the patients treated with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me compared the placebo group to improve lung function and ability to perform in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the percentage FE@@ V to be expected is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by the use of a combined end point ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , range in 6 @-@ minute walk , range of movement of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) observed .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the elderly patients with severe follow @-@ up form were limited or even no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ ogen@@ ous effects of various al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me dos@@ ages were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ of @-@ one application , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who do not yet receive chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant ) cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole treatment in patients who have not yet been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drugs against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
for patients whose blood pattern changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dis@@ continued or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of am@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin were 12.@@ 1 months on average , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta had longer survival times than with the comparison medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of necessary dosage is taken from the bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed administration and the day after the treatment .
at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken during the seven days before the first dose of ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last dose of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) a week before the first mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood sample should be created before each application , including differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the influence of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are to be applied for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value prior to treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 can @-@ reduction or so@@ - in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or over the age of 65 years there was an increased side @-@ effect risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , dose adjustments were not necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which should exceed the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin level and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ row suppression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils restore a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the needle of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ cot@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was repeated if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic action to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for whom a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is fores@@ een , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , advanced high blood pressure or diabetes .
for this reason , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered in patients with a clin@@ ically significant accumulation of fluid in the trans@@ lu@@ cellular space .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment @-@ tin to get advice on the conservation of sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased incidence of side effects .
therefore caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life time such as pi@@ ro@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites serious birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to get advice on the conservation of semen .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is passed into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the combined results of three single mixed mono@@ therapies ( n = 164 ) of phase 2 similar to the phase 2 mixed mono @-@ mixed mono@@ therapies , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans @-@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population since the P@@ ha@@ - and 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .

from clinical trials patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment occasionally reported cases of occasionally fatal intra@@ ocular pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
there have been reported cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate which performs its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several attack points , by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the following key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was demonstrated in the case of the Lun@@ ar gen@@ esis symptom@@ s@@ ala in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single c@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms revealed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on the overall survival occurred in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ disc epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0,@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separate random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment is similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus Gem@@ cit@@ abine in C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of the NSCLC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ disclosure limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients required the treatment of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.2 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed by offering as a mono@@ therapeu@@ tics were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is primarily ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dosage is found again in the urine in 24 hours after the application .

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who are allergic to allergy and can no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats that have been added to the food in@@ gest@@ ed to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared with placebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg compared to placebo .
in the All@@ i study in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , weight loss could not be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ work , stool strand , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , down o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or from ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or with breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ical , gre@@ asy diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and young people under 18 , as there are insufficient data for efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only absorbed minimal , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregn@@ ancies in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( Internation@@ ally ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the levels of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparations prior to bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
a marginal decline in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and coinci@@ de with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the frequency of reported side effects , detected after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were reported voluntarily by a population of uncertain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to ejac@@ ulations in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing were either reported to have no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the lip@@ em@@ ic properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect takes place in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
derived from clinical studies , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , has blocked absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ical , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight versus the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those participating in study , who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin amounted to 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with a placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at could not be measured 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
in general , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could be used spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and result in increasing fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of treatment , as at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional effects : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ based diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit will decrease . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a rich dessert , as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out the medicine for children in@@ accessible . • Do not apply any more than 25 ° C . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .

a permanent weight loss , for example , by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent the onset of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you will also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories that is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with the recommended fat intake is decisive .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by keeping the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies . • You should try to remove gradually and continuously .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you daily do little or no walk , climb stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means you can burn 150 k@@ cal per day , e.g. through 3 km of walking , 30@@ - to 45 minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ ory and fat targets and observe them . • Sen@@ ding is a food diary containing information about calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutrition plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ ory and fat @-@ duc@@ ts and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in conjunction with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your goal weight .
alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , and chem@@ o@@ therapies which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is insufficient information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in case of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute ion should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is required at the same time as pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is prolonged or that tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used in the days of chemotherapy , nor for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ cent@@ ration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ ox@@ ic@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , doc@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin , p@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron for human pregnancy does not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least might be related to Alo@@ xi , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the date of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out . however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective treatment for an al@@ op@@ ox@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and 250 m@@ g. Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 7,@@ 3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron received intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials of indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block ion channels in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ lic@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G @-@ effects of I.@@ V. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
following intraven@@ ous administration , an initial decrease in plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the equivalent level measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and around 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies on metabol@@ isation showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the iso@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made out about 40 % of the given dosage .
following a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in healthy dogs the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
though , in patients with severe liver function disorders , the terminal elimination sentence and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after exposure that is considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 of the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicated that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ lic@@ ar@@ isation and prolon@@ ging the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application in humans , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the prescription of the approval for the placing of the medicine prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by viral infections ) .
in a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue damage the liver tissue . furthermore , the values of the liver enzyme al@@ anine amine @-@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are abnormal in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which stimulates this to form the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon , the manufacturer of al@@ ph@@ eon , presented data to the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study in patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was adopted ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided by the CH@@ MP for the approval of the wrong placing ?
furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the medicines to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C related to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical trials .
after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease rose again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study investig@@ ates the question as to what extent the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ stal ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that were demon@@ stra@@ ble or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because of this type of infection may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 the skin surface to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was ble@@ ached at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were treated with placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin les@@ ions , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissues ) or infections that were demon@@ stra@@ ble or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common adverse event associated with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small hospitals , abra@@ sions , or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a permit for placing alt@@ ar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical drugs on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on abra@@ sive skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the simultaneous oral gift of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on S@@ low skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in terms of a statement affecting the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding should continue / stop or continue the therapy with alt@@ ar@@ go , the benefits of breast@@ feeding are to be considered for the infant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported side effect was irritation at the date of administration , which concerned about 1 % of patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the binding site of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ ą@@ g centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partly blocking P @-@ binding inter@@ acting and prevents the normal education of active 50s @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin may appear question@@ able at least some forms of infection , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences were found in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ os@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under the oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medi@@ cal@@ ation and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the final application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1 % sal@@ ve on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP @-@ in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with minor participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were indications of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid disorders .
in vitro examination on genetic mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in the rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

ambient lighting is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can lead to an end .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , &quot; as it can resist a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ines that have been approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ines that have been approved since 1997 , and the vacc@@ ines that have been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered within the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults have also been used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations one month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of ambient temperature was similar in a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components , or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals a permit for the aviation of Ambi@@ rix all over the world .
the standardi@@ zation plan for the pri@@ mm@@ mm@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ her vaccine is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B @-@ surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ V ) antibodies were the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent persons who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ vacc@@ ination should need a re@@ fres@@ her as protection since it may also be protected from immun@@ ological memory with no more demon@@ stra@@ ble antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the classification scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value after the pri@@ ming process , so that additional vacc@@ ination doses may be required in these cases .
since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ lication , these injection paths should be avoided .
however , in cases of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as an exception , as in these cases it can result in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge after intra@@ muscular injection .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ ous , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us @-@ type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined m@@ um@@ my m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , fatigue , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was comparable to the incidence observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged between 12 and including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix toler@@ ability was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per V@@ acc@@ ine Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects after receiving Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects had received Ambi@@ rix , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of suit@@ ability was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. about the entire vaccine at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received ambient atmosphere compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and fatigue was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vaccine , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , serum conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. month 7 ) .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s ser@@ o@@ conversion rates were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ x and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was valuable , the serum levels of serum ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the addition of the 3 @-@ dose implant significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses obtained in a clinical comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) have been reported in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses @-@ scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were at the time of pri@@ ori@@ tization between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine scheme .
the immune response against both anti@@ gens observed in this study was comparable to those found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine scheme .
if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the re@@ fres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ ous , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us @-@ type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to previous form@@ ulations for the present formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the re @-@ en@@ cyclo@@ pedia on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art approval is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before serving the two doses of vacc@@ ination , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be caused by it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If an allergic reaction has occurred with you / your child , an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B has occurred . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
in case of a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / she recommends 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vaccine against completion of the vaccine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated / has been inj@@ ected recently or has received immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as various limbs as possible .
if ambient temperature is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient .
typically , Ambi@@ rix does not admini@@ ster pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , except it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child / child .
if you miss the appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
smoking very often ( more than 1 case per 10 mixed doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the in@@ let or redness • Mat@@ ry@@ ness • irrit@@ ability • headaches • lack of appetite

ambient is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data that have become known since the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only brought into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited because of the low patient exposure .
am@@ on@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ on@@ aps is divided into several single boxes at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
this was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ soon could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do medication , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
am@@ on@@ aps can also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or flavor enh@@ ancements , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
Am@@ mon@@ soon was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , limited information on this drug was available .
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enz@@ ym@@ atic deficiency is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ ac form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency should be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the emergence of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve les@@ ions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during lac@@ tation period is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed to not be associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an impro@@ b@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ calcium , ar@@ mor@@ dium , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be believed to produce sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues .
through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen precip@@ itation ( sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born babies at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to increase to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
patients with a late mani@@ ac@@ al form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet were 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , where phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is formed .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in a so@@ ber healthy adult and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after individual release as well as repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an or@@ ally single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were observed 15 minutes after the intake .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a fatigue or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in plasma in the morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma gas were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
after the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no adverse effects in rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who do not yet swallow tablets , or given patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( active metabol@@ ite by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , les@@ ions were found in the pyramid cells of the brain cor@@ tex .
an impro@@ b@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ calcium , ar@@ mor@@ dium , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
cyclo@@ omet@@ rically seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment , and in some patients further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an or@@ ally single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ulate form , measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were observed 15 minutes after the intake .
during durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicines .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine can go into breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , om@@ is@@ sion of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example in case of unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ om@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during PCI the patient was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like Ab@@ ci@@ axi@@ mab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without G@@ PI administration - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as much as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ om@@ ox in relation to all indicators was just as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ om@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to biop@@ sy ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ om@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to approve the placement of angi@@ om@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ birth inf@@ ar@@ ction ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose can be resum@@ ed from 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements .
an injection of 0.5 mg / kg was administered immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ us release of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us @-@ administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI @-@ intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully bl@@ ended prior to the application and the bol@@ us dose can be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bias against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT @-@ value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ ali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox may be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible co@@ agulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ related patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ ant is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
although most ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges on arter@@ ial points occur in PCI @-@ patients among bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur everywhere during the treatment .
for patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with biop@@ sy ru@@ dine again reaches the level before the treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) , these substances can be assumed to increase the risk of bleeding .
the combination of biop@@ sy specimens with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters in each case to be checked regularly .
the animal experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as for patients over 65 years more often than in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe ble@@ ed@@ ings as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both mild and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common among bi@@ ali@@ br@@ ines than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ omet@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the area , which required radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduced ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding area , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding @-@ loc@@ aliz@@ ations occurring at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points of exception , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as for patients over 65 years more often than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common among bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ant , a direct and specific plat@@ el@@ et inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ onic acid region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of biop@@ sy ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and there@@ with its effect , is rever@@ sible because th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in in its part slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , a bi@@ vali@@ ant with serum from patients in which th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) had come to indu@@ ce no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed on the following PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ant should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ curing inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or with the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to control glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or that insulin is not effective .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot effectively operate insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin trap .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the stomach @-@ bridge .
due to the reduced amount of glucose and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change in effect , the brand ( producer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can lead to a change in insulin demand .
3 An inadequate dosage or the termination of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the change of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the timing of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the effect of the used insulin and can therefore change during the treatment process .
these include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ates , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , sympathy analo@@ gues such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pine may be weakened or absent from the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c antagon@@ ism .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ oids in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving loss of consciousness can be treated by a doctor using intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , or by intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ c@@ ite injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs more quickly and the duration of action is shorter than with cou@@ - and normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ l@@ - tus insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dose of proportional glucose concentration of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glucose concentration effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the total glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post @-@ den@@ den@@ dal gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with a human regular insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was dug in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ den@@ ial control was achieved than with a human regular insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with a human regular insulin , which is given 2 times before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal was given prior to the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) as well as in comparison to human regular insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ mal @-@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
