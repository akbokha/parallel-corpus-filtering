<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Authorization Report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wiry thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disorder where patients have regular episodes (periods of anorexic upsetting) alternating with periods of normal sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased agitation or behavioural disorders, if the oral consumption of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used for inserting or the enamel tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl presumably appears primarily as a "partial agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazl acts as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the brain activity, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness, with which of Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the changes in the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution for taking up.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with the injection solution, patients receiving Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in reducing the symptoms of increased anxiety than patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for inhalation (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (controlled shrinkage), acute (drowsiness), somnolence (drowsiness), nausea, nausea, fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased disturbance and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the placing of Abilify across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although single patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient population, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, oversight disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acoteric and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia arising during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or to break down the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be deposited.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to coma-bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazl by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolization, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensioners.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common application of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefit should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as isoconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose- reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be attributed with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphian / 3-method xymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazph) and 3A4 (dextromethorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data storage for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal's reproductive studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total less incidence (25,8%) of EPS, including Parkinson's, dystonia and dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients with Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is of benefit in the treatment of an overdose, since Aripiprazl has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin are mediated on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and to serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With the administration of Aripiprazl in dosages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C raclprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, the nucleus caudatus and the putative.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 of the responder patients who had a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperdol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Ask-Depressionaire scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazl group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed a placebo superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazl showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazl showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially did not respond to lithium or valproar monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in the reduction of manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl showed a superior outcome in the prevention of a bipolar decline in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyylation of Aripiprazole, which is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination rule is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl in extensive metabolizers above CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolisers about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazl there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did the pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences in the ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different cirrhosis of the liver (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data showed no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no significance for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equal to 3 to 10times the mean Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolites from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the sulfate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazl, the concentrations found in the study were not more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that led to expositions of the 3- and 11-fold of the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">To increase the resorption and minimize the variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by circumventing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines applied to conservation or acutely-therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the features of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify enamel tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution in patients with aggregation and behavioural disorders, which were different from schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepins is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, oversight disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acoteric and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia arising during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to combination-bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared with the single dose of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy subjects Aripiprazl (15 mg dose) was used as one-off dose intramuscularly and that at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'poor' metabolizers can result in a common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl in comparison with CYP2D6 extensioners.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- proteaseinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was higher compared with the after all the administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were reported more frequently in clinical trials with Aripiprazl injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events (*):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13,1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (Kreatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazl injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of agility / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggregation and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of asgitis and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepham reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from baseline value on PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 per cent of responder patients who had a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rates scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially did not respond to lithium or valproar monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in the reduction of manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl showed a superior outcome in the prevention of a bipolar decline in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazl AUC in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection is 90% greater than the AUC after administration of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazl injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra-muscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity according to intravenous application, no safety relevant concerns arose after maternal exposure, which was 15 (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety macology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data showed no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; this means they have limited or no significance for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) in case of female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolites from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that led to expositions of the 3- and 11-fold of the mid-steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in allsome administration or as monotherapy) was compared to that of a conventional paclitaxel dispenser (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">A total of 72 (31%) of 229 patients with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference in the efficacy indicators such as time to worsening the disease and survival between the drugs.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast to these indicators, patients who had previously received other treatments for metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may not be used in patients who are breastfeeding or have low neutrophils in the blood before the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The CHMP (CHMP) Committee stated that Abraxane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer more effective than conventional paclitaxel contained drugs and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other paclitaxel in order to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the Company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the placement of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised before treatment via sperm conservation, since the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect the perspiration and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 lists the side effects that have occurred in combination with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasional: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue-burn, dry mouth, toothed gum, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the thorax wall, weakness of the muscles, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness. very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in connection case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a timipriotubules agent that promotes the coagglomeration of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transzytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the framework of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumrezeptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour is performed due to the albuminbi protein SPARC (secretted protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two-arm unblinded studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received monotherapy with paclitaxel within 3 weeks, either in the form of a solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-Line therapy are presented below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for ablation at baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Active substance exposure (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous injection of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the large distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascularly distribution and / or soft binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel within a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane injection (43%) than after a solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine elimination was 4% of the total total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data were available for patients over 75 years of age, because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetical analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light-light protection for over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic medicine and, as with other potentially toxic substances, caution should be observed when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labeling and packing supplement. • With unambiguous depiction of the correct application of the product, equipped refrigerator boxes for transport by the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that it is similar to a biological medicinal product approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron values, in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abyamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with diseases indicated by the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abyamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by a erythropoietal deficiency or by the fact that the body does not respond adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the course of a major study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems, Abyamed was compared to the reference medicinal product.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to either seamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of injected intersecamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were examined in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients being reamed were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abyamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">It may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abyamed according to the regulations of the European Union it was proved that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces Abyamed will provide information packages for medical specialists in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma, which receive chemotherapy and the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, preexisting anaemia in the onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large amount of blood (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, Abyamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">Hb 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot take part in an autologous blood donor programme.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients with hemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anaemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; hence, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In light of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the durable hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose can be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for anaemia control and anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired finish is reached (this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anaemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; hence, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="396">In light of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for controlling the symptoms of anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the hemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl versus the initial value, the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the hemoglobin value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the precisculocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl versus the initial value, a response to the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%) in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood consertations is required should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins, so that large iron reserves are available prior to the onset of the Abyamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively present 300 I.U. / kg in 10 consecutive days, on the day of the procedure and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml of isotonic boiling saline to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from the treatment with any erythropoietin on a erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive any seamed or other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are provided for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and which cannot participate in an autologous blood donor programme, the use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, adjuvant or cerebrovascular diseases, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular illness; in patients with a recent heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenia (PRCA) Very rarely has been reported about the appearance of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of efficacy, defined as a reduction in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the toxic tendency should be determined and the common causes of non-response (iron, folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminescence-toxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reciprolocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reproductive-cyte "index), is low (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microlitres or &lt; 0,5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of an effective loss is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of intersecamed patients with a risk of an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration specified in Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the administration of epoetins when the hemoglobin concentration is increased by concentration on the control of anaemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with kidney failure, which are not dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumor patients receiving chemotherapy, epoetin alfa has a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoietin response (patients who need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk weighing involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are provided for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, the cause of anaemia should be studied and treated accordingly before the epoetin-alfa therapy begins.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate prophylaxis since they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa can be an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events for patients with an initial poole value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporine dose can be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies of tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF concerning hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Via thrombotic, vascular events like myocardical ischemia, myocardial infarcts, cerebrovascular attacks, deep venous thromboses, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thromboses, aneurysms, retinalthromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with erythropoietin treatment, so also patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common adverse effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetins.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was investigated over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Paget, Actsta was tested in two trials to 357 patients and compared with the Risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of fractures in patients with Aclasta (without other osteoporosis patients) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis patients), the risk of fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent with repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with acetonize are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteonecrosis (the death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Acpsta's manufacturer provides clarification material for doctors who prescribe acetonize for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains instructions on how to apply the medicine, as well as a similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of Paget, Acpsta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of Paget with Accista a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient supply of calcium, corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen briefly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Actsta is not recommended as there are limited clinical experience for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and young people Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, as data for safety and efficacy is missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Prior to the onset of therapy with Aclasta, an existing hypocremia should be treated with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypothermia can develop, the maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient supply of calcium, corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction zoledronic acid was associated with renal dysfunction associated with renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a limited renal function were similar in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the Placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine in 10 days of the application was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2,10 mmol / l), compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplementary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study on preventing clinical fractures after hip fracture and in the disease pathogenesis (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on preventing clinical fractures after a recently developed hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of zoledronic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the infusion station, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been reported, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw region) that have been treated with bisphosphonates, including cannabinoid acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients responded to osteoarthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Aclasta and in a patient treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebrate fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new vertebrate fractures (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Acetonio-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebrate fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on aclasta hip fractures showed an equally lasting effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in one by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Accista increased bone density on lumbar vertebrate, hip and distal radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increment of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the lower spine by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) one year after the third annual dose bone biopsies were taken from the pelvis.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture compared with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C telephonic (b-CTx) in serum were measured in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, BSAP was significantly reduced by 30% compared to baseline and was maintained at 28% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline after 12 months and was maintained at 52% below baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>

<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125,000 I.E. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the treated group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased BMD compared to placebo treatment at all points of time.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to placebo for an increase of the BMD by 5.4% on the overall half and by 4.3% at the lower half.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT trial, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Accista-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308) the once annual dose of Aclasta was not inferior compared to once weekly gift of alendronate to the percentage change of lumbar vertebrae after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Acactin was examined in patients and patients over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly mild to moderate acute morphology Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2,6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid compared to intake of 30 mg of Risedronate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Actsta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with aclasta and 107 with Risedronate patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response to 141 patients treated with aclasta compared to 71 patients treated with Risedronat will be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma levels decreased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearances from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long elimination of exclusion with a terminal exclusion period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above and ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total-body-Clearance amounts irrespective of the dose: 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in the rate of zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the area below the curve (plasma concentration versus time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of the mettochrome-P450 enzyme systems metabolized substances is unlikely because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in the 64 patients examined.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction until down to a creatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the zoledron acid requires.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatina- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest intravenous, intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and a body weight of 0.6 mg / kg in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In trials of dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC mean 6x of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was given the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid in rats by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x of human-therapeutic exposure related to AUC, corresponds to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as on the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphor of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages ranging from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum-calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a substance of a substance called bisphosphonate, and is used for osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget disease.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens, which are made from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">At the Paget disease, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing the bone structure, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and gives the bone strength again.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Authorization Report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphonyl resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the acetate treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulphonyl resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level falls, making type 2 diabetes more difficult to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of acetone was studied in tripletherapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced when applying the dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of acetone and a sulphonyl resin in a reduction of HbA1c values decreased by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin decreased HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who also took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypotheses (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to approve Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under the age of 18, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are threatened by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema, if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macvascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme parameters can be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unresolved nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme parameters are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether to continue the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazon should be guided by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">Hemodilution is a minor reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparisons-controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral double or triple combination therapy with a sulfonylurea or dual-combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch was reported under treatment with thiazoldindia, including pioglitazone, an occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the appearance of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report on disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparable medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparable medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or does this, treatment should be cancelled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blockers and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC from Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hyperinsulinemia resulting from pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 1000; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not invaluable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the lens and refractive index of the lens, as seen in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents were equal to three times the upper limit of the normal range, compared to placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macvascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under pioglitazone, but more often if pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the treated groups and over 7,400 patients in the treated groups treated with comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study, which lasted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparable medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have a activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferation activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ), resulting in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It has been shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is omitted (defined as HbA1c ≥ 0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of optimization with insulin was randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients was statistically significant compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol and a slight but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced total plasma glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was found under pioglitazone, while values diminished under metformin and Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a 20-week study, pioglitazone not only reduced the triglyceride levels but also improved the post-prandial triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption and the epatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macvascular disease were randomised in groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, pioglitazone is resorbed quickly, whereby the top concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in the plasma usually reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to the efficacy in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies proved that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the Fäces (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unmodified pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral clearance of the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys appeared in accordance with repeated administering plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the insulin resistance resulting from the gestation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal, thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazoldindiones resulted in increased frequency of colonic tumours.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparable medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study, over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were examined with Pioglitazone or Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotient was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a 20-week study, pioglitazone not only reduced the triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which has an effect on Tryglyceride absorption and the epatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target of its primary endpoint, a combination of the overall mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long-term risks associated with the intake of pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="874">Any change regarding starch, brand (manufacturer), type of insulin (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (recombinant DNA versus insulin-origin) can cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take into account the possible interactions during the therapy and always ask his patients for other medications taken from them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in non-sufficiently controlled diabetes care, increase the risk of deformities and fruit death in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias may lead to loss of consciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Occasionally - Peripheral Neuropathy A quick improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort associated with acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 A intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar level may, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints at the administration site Occasionally - Local hypersensitivity reaction at the injection site During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection site) may occur.</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Occasionally - urticaria, exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angionic edema, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, hypoglycemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juices. • Serious hypoglycemias involving loss of consciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an undiagnosed aid or by glucose that is given intravenously by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the effective maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorption Profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with a fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of split (hydrolysis) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1184">Since there are no experiences in organ transplant receivers, the application of Febuxostat in this patient group is not recommended (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">In patients with ischemic heart disease or uncompensated heart failure, the treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other resinous medicines, acute rheumatism can occur during the treatment period because the lowering of serum resin levels may initially mobilize uric acid deposits in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">For example, in malignant diseases and their treatment, lesch- Nyhan-syndrome) the absolute concentration of xanthin in the urine often increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver diseases During phase 3 clinical studies, mild symptoms of the liver function were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the febuxostator and in the subsequent course (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwasn't have any interactions with Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO-hibition can lead to a rise in theophyll level (a blocking of theophylline metabolism was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous addition of febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in febuxostats exposure (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%) was associated.</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x had an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delays the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a 32% decrease in CMAx, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not include side effects of febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>

<seg id="1200">The risk factors determined by these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects, which could be observed in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of febuxostat and which have been reported in all febuxostat treatment groups more than once, are listed below.</seg>

<seg id="1204">The events reported during the long-term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported more than once in all Febuxostats treatment groups and were reported to patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to information.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies of phase 3 or at a lower frequency:</seg>

<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The effectiveness of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of Phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum levels were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 269) for patients with a serum increment value at the beginning of studies of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventionally used doses Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventionally used dose Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1216">Lowering serum levels of serum to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and continued throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">The primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with renal function of the APEX-study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction (ie.).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum resin concentration in subjects, despite their renal function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">The primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum resin concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients needed a treatment against gout in the months of 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of the patients did not need any treatment against ginning).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout nodes, which resulted in 54% of the patients' complete disappearance until month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µie / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from febuxostat after administration are easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, a rise in AUC is observed for febuxostat, which is greater than the dose proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentration, provided this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent flow state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is about 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsoms showed that these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid mainly results from UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After intake of an 80 mg dose of Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found as unaltered febuxostat (3%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair found itself as unaltered febuxostat (12%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average total AUC of febuxostat increased by about 1.8-fold of 7.5 μ g rhino / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ g acute / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver functional limitation After intake of multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (ChildPugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) liver function restriction, the CMAx and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumors (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, in about 11-fold of exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purine metabolization and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It was found that febuxostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In high doses, which were about 4 times the humantherapeutical exposure, maternal toxicity arose, accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in carrying rats with expositions, which approximately 4.3-fold and in bearing rabbits with expositions, which were approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure, did not reveal teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient may not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day, which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronate and vitamin D3 are already separated from each other in medicines approved in the European Union, the company submitted data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who exclusively took Alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of digestive tract, constipation, diarrhea (diarrhea), ulcers (ulcera), ulsphagia (swallowing), hampered abdomen (blower abdomen) as well as acidic bumping.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE should not be used in patients with any hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after rising the day. • Patients are not to chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth, since there is no risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract except pyloroplastic, are given only under special care (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Oesophageal reactions such as oeshagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal stric, were reported in patients taking alendronate (partially these were severe and requiring hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all the signs and symptoms that indicate possible reactions, and patients should be advised to stop the medicine in case of symptoms of ophageal irritation like dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternal heartburn or new or worsening heartburn.</seg>
<seg id="1293">3. the risk of severe adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue to take symptoms following an oesophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with alendronate no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcera (after market launch), among them some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen mainly administer intravenously administered bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available that indicate whether a bisphosphonate treatment is reduced in patients who require a maxillofacial surgery to reduce the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>

<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before the treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, alendronate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended for postmenopausal women only and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or lactating women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoneksis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports were reported by cancer patients, however, osteoporosis was also reported.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, the serum-calcium levels up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and the serum phosphate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) occurred in both treatment groups with similar rates.</seg>

<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronat, a 48% reduction (Alendronate 3.2% compared to placebo 6.0% compared to placebo 6.0%) was achieved in patients with one or more vertebrate fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the evidence of the BMD of the spine and the Trochanter continued; the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.</seg>

<seg id="1324">Following an intravenous reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after a night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">The bioavailability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis, Alendronate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day for five days) led to no clinically important change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distributions of rats revealed that Alendronate is temporarily divided into soft tissue after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but is then quickly divided into the bones or excreted with the urine.</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation where the application of Advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograf or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a treatment period of one year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter studies of 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant were performed and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this drug or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this may lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; constellations of the formulation or of the regime should only be undertaken under the closely meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">Following a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in the individual case and on blood-level provisions (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus-Talks should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure measured as a tallow level was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus tallow levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate night primate phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low-clearance substance, adjusting the dose can take several days before the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application For the suppression of graft rejection, immunosuppression has to be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advant therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change after the transplant is stabilised.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advant therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switch from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted from 2 daily doses of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion has to be done in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), in relation to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressants to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the oral initialdose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation is to begin with the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients, which are converted to Advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplant patients, was used in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in case of pancreatic transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood tallies in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of serum levels, a calculation of the creatine intakes and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the help of full-blood-tacrolimus-tallow-level control.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tacrolimus-tallow levels during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Even after switching from Prograf to Advagraf, dosage adjustment, immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearing, adjustments may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of the tallow in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the ageing levels of Tacrolimus in the whole blood usually stem from 5 - 20 ng / ml and transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur due to tacrolimus sub-exposure or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; constellations of the formulation or of the regime should only be undertaken under the closely meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In order to treat adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">No clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf is available for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, taking herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies can be avoided during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea a particularly careful observation of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf a chamber or septum hypertrophy described as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking Tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and blurred vision, should be a radiological examination (e.g..</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antifungal drugs such as ketoconazole, Fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazol as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 whose metabolism is impaired.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the level of hormone exposition, decisions concerning contraceptive actions are particularly careful.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus potentially reduces the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies on transplant patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immunosuppressiva, an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, monitoring of the newborn is recommended for any adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1463">Ischemic interference of the coronary vessels, tachycardia chamber arrhythmia and cardiac arrest, heart failure, myocardiopathy, chamber hypertrophy, supraventricular arrhythmia, palpitatio, anomalies in the ECG, abnormal heart and pulse rate</seg>
<seg id="1464">Diarrhoea, nausea gastrointestinal inflammation, gastro-intestinal ulcer and perforation, bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, stomatitis, vomiting, pain in the gastrointestinal area and abdomen, dyspeptic signs and symptoms, obstipation, flatulence, flatulence and bloating, loose stools, signs and symptoms in the gastrointestinal area</seg>
<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases As is well known in other highly effective immunosuppressants is often increased in patients treated with tacrolimus, susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoidal).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of non-virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppressive therapy, including therapy with Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be conveyed through its binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to calcially dependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of lymphoma genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute rejection within the first 24 weeks in the Advagraf group (N = 237) 32.6% and in the Prograf group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>

<seg id="1474">Kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of Advagraf and Prograf was compared each in combination with mycophenolatmofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, in 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Patients survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for Advagraf and 97.5% for Prograf; in the Advagraf arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Prograf arm 8 (3 women, 5 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advagraf, each in combination with Basiliximab, MMF and corticosteroids, was compared with 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of treatment failure after 12 months (defined as death, graft rejection, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the Advagraf group (N = 214), 15.1% in the group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagram Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advagraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf Ciclosporin) (Prograf Ciclosporin) (Prograf Ciclosporin) (Prograf Ciclosporin) (5,2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>

<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of twice daily applied Prograf capsules according to other primary organ transplants Prograf has become a recognized primary immunosuppressant after pancreatic, lung and intestinal transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 patients transplant patients, with 475 patients undergoing pancreatic transplantation and in 630 cases were used as primary immunosuppressant in 630 cases.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies was consistent with the large studies where Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent, multicenter study with oral Prograf, more than 110 patients were reported to receive either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis's obliteral syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In patients treated with tacrolimus, in 21,7% of cases the cases of bronchiolitis in obliterans were compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 0.02) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients being converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was increased after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of bronchiolitis's obliteral syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pankreastransplantation A multi-center study with oral Prograf was conducted to 205 patients undergoing a pancreas and kidney transplantation following a randomized trial of Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired tallow level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral stave as a primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplants showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolizumab, and recently graft-radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocrit value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound fraction of Tacrolimus or a strengthening of metabolism brought about by treatment with corticosteroids shall be responsible for the higher clearances observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus can be metabolized almost entirely before excretion, whereby the excretion mainly occurs through the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than Prograf in stable patients (once daily) on Advagraf (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg).</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tacrolimus-tallow levels during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 In order to treat adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1499">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (one due to the lack of Factor VIII conditional, congenital blood clotting disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advrates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables it to form the human clotting factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new bleeding episodes marked "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the placing of Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the place and the extent of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, reach different in vivo recovery and have different half-times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding with a proper dose is not ruled out, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be directed at the patient's notice, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk is greatest within the first 20 days of exposure and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositional days and anamnestic inhibitors development, recombinant inhibitors were observed after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs, which occur in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients), who showed a higher risk of inhibitors formation, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare &lt; 1 / 000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood clotting factor VIII-Spike occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and both the Factor VIII- mirror in the plasma as well as the clearing-rate showed again sufficient values on the 15 postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days with ADVATE.</seg>
<seg id="1561">Furthermore, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) was diagnosed after previous exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients from a ongoing clinical study, 5 out of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE treated inhibitors against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody titre against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak of anti-CHO cell protein, but there were no signs or symptoms that indicated an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiler granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reports over-sensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency not known).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to assess the benefit-risk weighing as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited announced the CHMP's Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company takes its application for approval for the transport of advecin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that connect and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus" which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the p53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who entered Li-Fraumeni-Cancer in the area of the lower abdomen, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the company's answers to the questions he asked, there were still some questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of advecin in Li-Fraumeni tumours benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notify the CHMP if the withdrawal consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "changing drug release" "" "" "" "means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nose pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose) are clung.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be relieved on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When examining all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who took Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who took desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity, constipation, headache, tiredness, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), somnolence and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, against adrenergic substances or laucomadin (other medicines for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from an angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary tract (hypertension), hyperthyroiosis (hypertension) or have a hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aerinaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is generally swallowed (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have dissipated.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decreasing the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks of termination of such a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva which can be attributed to phenylpropanol, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetazoline, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data were not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment should be deposed in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze has a minimum of 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol was administered, no clinically relevant interactions were observed or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor study showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and the placebo-treated patients regardless of whether or not loratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins are.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerosae during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerosaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to dizziness that may result in impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with potential lethal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult Miktion, muscle weakness, increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precepid pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupil starre and dilatation, skin irritations, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the release of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophila as well as the inhibition of expression of the adhesion molecules P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In an adult single dose study, desloratadin 5 mg did not have any influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight track including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years aged between 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by nasal mucous swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze for healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equivalent of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of desloratadin were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the allotted application of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was for exposure to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of laurel / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 the pharmacovigilance system described in module 1.8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and tearing or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases under the use of Aerinaze: high blood pressure • Heart chase, heart beat • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When applying at the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerinaze conducts dizziness or decreases attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should inform you immediately your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>

<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chasing, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspicuous liver-values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg of lyophilizer for inserting (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in 5 ml syrup or 5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was investigated in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who had also asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the loops, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes syrup, the solution for the intake and the enamel tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of aperius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials in Urticaria, the decrease in the symptoms of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, loratadin, or any of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the present disease progression and can be stopped after the symptoms have passed and resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Patients with persistent allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol were administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not amplified while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should be informed, however, that in very rare cases it may lead to dizziness that may result in impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with aperius at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1,2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 adolescent patients of 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the release of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophila as well as the inhibition of expression of the adhesion molecules P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses that were administered at a dose of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, no prolongation of the Qtc interval showed itself.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study involving adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight track, including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall score of the questionnaire to improve the quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was substituted for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology, despite the etiology of different forms, is similar and can be recruited to chronically patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine is a causative factor in all types of urticaria, it is expected that besides the chronically idiopathic urticaria, in other forms of urticaria, this will lead to an improvement in symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving prevalence and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, a higher concentration of desloratadin was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after a daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially informed the CHMP's Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company is accepting its application for Aflunov's permission to prevent aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A pandemic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from man to person, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus in the vaccine as "foreign" and makes antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane manure of the virus was dissociated with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognizes as a foreign body), and is used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data basis for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment, please contact your attending doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for disposing, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the physician has checked out which antiviral drug the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of having the virus to respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice a day 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenera depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral drugs, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">However, AIDS cannot cure AIDS, but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases related to AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">In 206 adults who used protease inhibitors were compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not previously taken protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drugs called Ritonavir increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which were resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase, together with Ritonavir, came to a stronger viral load after four weeks than in patients who took their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be used in patients who take St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines which are degraded as well as Agenerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (the death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by a relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years have outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "" "" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "" "", "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children aged 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules should be given to the pharmacokinetic booster of Amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution for inserting is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for inserting on a milligram per milligram base are not exchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (Boogie), higher doses should be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function, including chronic active hepatitis, show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids which are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking these drugs at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under a age of four and should be used with care in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucosa is involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, which were necessary for their therapy to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B), which were treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), leading to serious clinical conditions or worsening symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial aetiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be given along with medicines whose agents are mainly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC from Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse reactions were often observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be degraded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the Amprenavirus levels and, if possible, to check the viral load and reduce the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nelfinavir is given together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">If Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily), Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) was reduced by 30%.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day were used, proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with Kaletra (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, close-meshed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study to use Agenerase in combination with Didanosine, however, due to the antacids component of Didanosine it is recommended that the proceeds of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that nevirapine may reduce serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as Delavirus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution must be advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir is difficult on Delavirus.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous addition of Amprenavir and Rifabutin caused a rise in the plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase of side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction of the dosage of rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dosage, although no clinical data are available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in an increase of CMAx by Ketoconazol in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2.69times compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may interact if they are used together with Agenerase, possibly interact with interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids do not be taken at the same time as aggraase as it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulsants which are known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, riodipine, Isradipine, Nicpine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine and Verapamil can be increased by increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with PDE5 inhibitors associated side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous addition of Agenerase with Ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are to be expected at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a rhubdomyolysis, the combined use of these pharmaceuticals with Amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic levels to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while offering Amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with an orally recorded midazolam (see Section 4.3) while using parenteral midazolam while simultaneously applying Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3-4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons currently no recommendation can be given, as the Amprenavirus dose is to be adjusted when Amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous addition of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as apgenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful balancing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In milk lactose-related rats, Amprenavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether Amprenavir passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, administered by the implantation in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase of 12 body weight during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with Agenerase were mild to moderate severity, rose early and rarely lead to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to taking Agenerase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fat subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsoceral fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-pretreated people who were treated with Amprenavir in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudine for a median duration of 36 weeks, only one case was observed (stitches) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 patients treated with 245 NRTIs compared to 27 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makuepapules nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amprenavir had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiating an antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice a day with low dose Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of side effects (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; one exception formed increases in triglyceride and CPK values, which were treated very frequently in patients who received Agenerase along with low dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the processing of viral gene and gag pol- polyprotein levels with the result of an unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated in both acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood-lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0,08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of Amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not yet been defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">Treatment antiretroviral treated patients with the currently registered Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages were rarely observed - as in other Ritonavir-based regimens with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred 48 hours, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 included patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / M / V, I47V, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) involving protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M /</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance tests, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genes associated with reduced sensitivity to Amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir Resistenzpfade, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-pretreated patients with which a Fosamprenavirus-containing schema failed (one of them showed a resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 insulates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 insulates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 insulates), saquinavir (three of 24 insulates) and animal pranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 insulates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of Agenerase's efficacy in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which treated with PI pre-treated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-interlayer threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbiased Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children between 2 and 18 years of age, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase solution was tested twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the potential benefit of "unbridged" Agenerase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children with PI pre-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">By contrast, 508% increased for CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent volume of distribution amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and indicates a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of Amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound Amprenavir representing the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components varies during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the area of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 therefore need to be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to similar daily Amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is made from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram-basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to Amprenavir plasma levels similar to those who are achieved twice a day after a dose of 1200 mg of Amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administering of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity in mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas occured in doses of 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after two daily application of 1200 mg of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and In-vitro-genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutations test, mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral lymphoma, Amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proved in clinical practice by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity in patients was observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of Agenerase nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to humans, a number of minor changes including thymus juggling and minor skeletal changes were observed, indicating a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (Boogie), higher doses should be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with weak or slight hepatic dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be set in duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucosa is involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with drug-dependent factors such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC from Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">If Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily), Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) was reduced by 30%.</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with Kaletra (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, close-meshed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution must be advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir is difficult on Delavirus.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction of the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dosage is 31, although no clinical data are available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, riodipine, Isradipine, Nicpine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous addition of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administering Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmine of Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful balancing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, administered by the implantation in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in body weight during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of Agenerase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdose, the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated in both acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">On the other hand, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the potential benefits of "unbundled" Agenerase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children with PI pre-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components varies during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the area of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss..</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 therefore need to be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2090">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible; therefore, the effect of renal dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2091">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity in mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas occured in the case of dosages, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of exposure to humans after two daily application of 1200 mg of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="2095">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2096">These results suggest that in young the metabolism channels are not yet fully mature, leaving Amprenavir or other critical components of the formulation (z).</seg>
<seg id="2097">Agenerase solution for disposing is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children aged 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="2098">The benefit of using Ritonavir "geboosterter" Agenerase solution for inserting was not documented in patients with PI pre-treated patients or with PI pre-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution for inserting is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for inserting on a milligram per milligram base are not exchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agenerase solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) Amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg of Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of Agenerase solution for the intake and low-dose Ritonavir, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adjustment for Amprenavir is not considered necessary, an application of Agenerase is contraindicated in patients with renal failure (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene glycol content, Agenerase is a solution for infants and children under 4 years of age, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects such as arrhythmia (z).</seg>
<seg id="2106">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="2107">The present antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent risk 47 of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="2108">For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Agenerase should be set in duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucosa is involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2110">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with drug-49 dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2111">In hemophilic patients (type A and B), which were treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="2112">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC from Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2113">If Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily), Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) was reduced by 30%.</seg>
<seg id="2114">The simultaneous intake of Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with PDE5 inhibitors associated side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2115">Based on data on 54 other CYP3A4 inhibitors, a significantly higher plasma concentration of Midazolam is expected after oral administration of Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="2116">The potential risk for humans is not known. Agenerase solution for inhaling may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fetus on the propylglycol contained in pregnancy (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2191">An increased risk of severe local skin irritation (see section 4.2.) In rare cases, severe local skin irritation persisted, which necessitated a treatment and / or caused temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine, which necessitated emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">For the application of imiquimod cream immediately following treatment with other cutaneous injections applied to the treatment of external genital and periodontitis treatments, no clinical experience has yet been available.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Limited data suggest an increased rate of inclinatory reductions in HIV-positive patients, imiquimodine cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group with regard to the removal of the tilt warts.</seg>
<seg id="2195">Treatment of basal cell carcinoma with imiquimiodine within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips, or hairline was not studied.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with imiquimodine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions, a treatment break may be made several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin for about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">As there are currently no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of supernatural basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experience in patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, therefore the use of previously untreated tumours is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2), there is a lower probability of response to the Imiquimodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lipstick.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of imiquimod for the treatment of acute keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actin keratosis on the forearms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions normally decrease in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after settling the therapy with imiquimodine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study reveals that patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immunostimulating properties, Imiquimodine cream should be used with care in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not produce any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) are not achieved after one-off or more topical application, no recommendation can be given to use during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and considered probable or possibly associated with the application of imiquimod cream in related side effects in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions to the site of the treatment of the inclinically treated patients (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and considered probable or possibly associated with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The Basalioma patients treated by 185 with imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled clinical study of phase III reported side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse event associated with the application of imiquimod crème was in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimod-creme were listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This review provided by the study plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials, with three-week treatment with imiquimod, it often results in local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreoriation / slipping / scraping (23%) and edema (14%).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the review plan, the evaluation of clinical signs showed that in these studies, with five times weekly treatment with imiquimod crème, severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and heavy shrinkage and tillage (19%) came.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the application of imiquimod for the treatment of acute keratosis, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental one-off oral absorption of 200 mg of Imiquimodine, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia, normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetical study, systemic concentrations of the alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, it was shown that the efficacy of a complete healing of the inclinations in Imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of patients treated with imiquimod treated patients completely; this was the case with 20% of the patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimiodine at five times a week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumours were histologically confirmed single primary super-cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Imiquimodine's efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, not hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic acne lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 area of treatment on the uncomfortable scalp or on the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indication externals, acute keratosis and hypermodified basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was investigated in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies in the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimodine cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute keratosis was observed in the three-week-weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that Imiquimod's resorption was low after topical application to MC-diseased skin of patients at the age of 6-12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acute keratosis or supernatural basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four month study on the dermal toxicity in the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased milz weight; a study of the current application, which was carried out for four months, did not result in similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on the carcinogenicity in mice in three days a week did not induce tumors at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the drug-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their previous lives.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be used for flat actinic keratoses in the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the best suited treatment for you.</seg>

<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have applied other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is non-prescription medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara cream because it is not known whether Imiquimiodine overcomes breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment varies from cowork, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratoses (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the tilt warts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully drained.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowards under the foreskin have to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara Cream?").</seg>

<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the mentioned side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you may feel itching (32% of the patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied to Aldara Cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions, which resend within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes at the application site (secretion, inflammation, swelling, scarring, skin destruction, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and tiredness.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements hampered, decreased lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a physician who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with rebel devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines before administration to prevent allergic reactions.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly examined the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect on the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aging in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), spinal pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), feeling of heat, fever, and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be disclosed every year and if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive alduracyms with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, egg stock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient tolerates this, up to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of alduracyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of alduracyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Althirazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect associated with infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in a suitable clinical environment where recovery facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the phase III clinical trial, almost all IgG antibodies against laronidase are expected, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions must be treated with caution when using alduracyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As there is little experience in the resumption of treatment after a longer break, cautiously, due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction, it is necessary to proceed cautiously after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before the onset of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyrees) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment should be considered with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used at the same time with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular uptake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were mainly due to infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older for a duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditional involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history, severe reactions to, including bronchospasm, breathing stills and facial edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable Drug Repercussions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients under 5 years, with predominantly severe follow-up form and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients had a seroconversion in 3 months after the start of the treatment, with a more severe form of follow-up in patients under the age of 5 (average after 26 days vs. 45 days for patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to early retirement from the study), 13 / 45 patients had no antibodies (RIP) for detectable antibodies, including 3 patients with which it had never been a seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in urine, while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginally to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, the most probable about mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire range of diseases, the majority of patients were of the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute walking distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Althirazyme every week for a further 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of treatment, the patients treated with Althirazyme compared the placebo group to improve lung function and ability to perform in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Althirazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Althirazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the percentage FEV to be expected is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the GAG-Spiegel in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by the use of a combined end point (expected percentage normal FEV, range in 6-minute walk, range of movement of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%) observed.</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe follow-up form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were observed after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in the elderly patients with severe follow-up form were limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations on pharmacogenous effects of various alduracyme dosages were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile of patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in one-of-one application, toxicity in repeated application and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2342">In patients suffering from MPS I, an enzyme called α -L-Iduronidase, which splits certain substances in the body (glycosaminoglycans), is either absent in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to one of the components of Althirazyme or if you have an allergic reaction to laronidase has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2344">An infusion-related reaction is any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4 "What side effects are possible).</seg>
<seg id="2345">Please inform your doctor if you take medications that contain chloroquin or procaine because there is a possible risk of diminished effects of alduracyme.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken, including non-prescription medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Instructions for handling - thinning and application The concentrate to manufacture an infusion solution must be diluted prior to use and is intended for intravenous use (see information for doctors and medical specialists).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient tolerates this, will gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I- conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre-history, however, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing stills and facial edema.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence in more than 1 of 10 patients): • headache • nausea, abdominal pain • rash, joint pain, back pain, pain in the arms and legs • redness • fever • chills • increased pulse • hypertonia • less oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the infusion point</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the package supplement will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not immediately used, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, if thinning was performed under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Alsatiazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Depending on the body weight of the individual patient, first determine the number of bottles to be diluted.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who do not yet receive chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant) cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body. • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer, which does not attack the squamous epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole treatment in patients who have not yet been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, the patients should take a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (drugs against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a liquid deficiency) should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">For patients whose blood pattern changes or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, discontinued or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of amlimta in a study of 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with Cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin were 12.1 months on average, compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells in the administration of Alimta had longer survival times than with the comparison medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the transport of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of necessary dosage is taken from the bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid will be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetremixed administration and the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">At least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven days before the first dose of phemetremixed and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last dose of the pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) a week before the first mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetrexed, a complete blood sample should be created before each application, including differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanine-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into account the influence of the Nadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the preceding therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are to be applied for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop-haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 can-reduction or so- in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or over the age of 65 years there was an increased side-effect risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, dose adjustments were not necessary in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which should exceed the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin level and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-fold the upper limit value (for the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone marrow suppression and Pemetrexed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophils restore a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the needle of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in previous cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of the grade 3 / 4 haematological and nicotmatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was repeated if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic action to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non-steroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for whom a therapy with Pemetrexed is foreseen, must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, advanced high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For this reason, a drainage of the effusion is to be considered in patients with a clinically significant accumulation of fluid in the translucellular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetremixed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment-tin to get advice on the conservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g per day) result in reduced Pemetremixed excretion with the result of increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advised if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life time such as piroxicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- or antimetabolites serious birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to get advice on the conservation of semen.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed is passed into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized Cisplatin and Pemetrexed and 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive Cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Side effects Frequency indications: very common (≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 000 and &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 000 and &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (not invaluable on the basis of available data of spontaneous reports).</seg>
<seg id="2412">* Regarding the National Cancer Institute CTC Version 2 for any toxicity except the event "Creatinin Clearance degraded" * * which was derived from the term "kidney / genital tract others." * * * Beyed to National Cancer Institute CTC (v2.0; NCI 1998), taste disorder and hair loss should be reported as Grade 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="2413">For this table a threshold of 5% was specified regarding the inclusion of all events where the consulted physician held a connection with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Clinically relevant CTC toxicity reported at &lt; 1% (occasionally) of the patients who received randomised cisplatin and pemetrexed, included arrhythmia and motor neuropathy.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported at &gt; 5% of 265 patients who received randomised pemetrexed as monotherapy with gifts of folate and vitamin B12 and 276 patients who were randomized to docetaxel as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2416">* Regarding National Cancer Institute CTC Version 2 for any toxicity degree. * * Beyed to National Cancer Institute CTC (v2.0; NCI 1998) should be reported hair loss only as Grade 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="2417">For this table a threshold of 5% was specified regarding the recording of all events where the consulted physician held a connection with Pemetremixed for possible.</seg>
<seg id="2418">Clinically relevant CTC toxicity, which were reported at &lt; 1% (occasionally) of the patients who received randomised pemetrexed, included supraventricular arrhythmias.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The clinically relevant laboratory toxicity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the combined results of three single mixed monotherapies (n = 164) of phase 2 similar to the phase 2 mixed mono-mixed monotherapies, excluding neutropenia (12.8% compared with 5.3%) and an increase in alanine trans-aminase (15.2% compared to 1.9%).</seg>
<seg id="2420">These differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population since the Pha- and 2 studies included both chemonaive and clearly pre-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests.</seg>
<seg id="2421">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects possible in connection with the study medication; they were reported at &gt; 5% of 839 Patients with NSCLC who received randomised cisplatin and pemetrexed and 830 patients with NSCLC who were randomised cisplatin and gemcitabine.</seg>

<seg id="2426">Serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular insult and transitory ischemic attacks were occasionally reported in hospitals with Pemetremixed, which is usually given in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2427">From clinical studies patients with pemetremixed treatment were occasionally reported cases of coli- tis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, intestinal perforation, intestinal necrosis and typhlitis).</seg>
<seg id="2428">From clinical trials patients with Pemetremixed treatment occasionally reported cases of occasionally fatal intraocular pneumonitis with respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There have been reported cases of acute renal failure in Pemetrexed monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients who were irradiated before, during or after their Pemetrexed therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic antifolate which performs its effect by interrupting important folate-dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an antifolate with several attack points, by blocking the thymidylatynthase (DHFR) and Glycinamiribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), the following key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multi-center, randomized, single-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically important advantage of a median 2.8-month prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only treated with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medication in the treatment arm (randomized and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement in clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnoe) in connection with the malignant pleuramesothelioma was demonstrated in the case of the Lunar genesis symptomsala in the ALIMTA / cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the single cispla- tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms revealed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / cisplatin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multi-center, randomised, open Phase III study with ALIMTA versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was median survival of 8.3 months (Intent to treat Population n = 283) and 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on the treatment effect on the overall survival occurred in favor of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-disc epithelial histological type (n = 0,78; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00, p = 0.047), adapted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited data from a separate randomised, controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for pemetremixed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) pre-treatment is similar to docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The efficacy analyses of the PQ population are consistent with the analyses of the ITT population and support the non-superiority of the ALIMTA Cisplatin versus Gemcitabine in Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Mean PFS was 4.8 months for the combination ALIMTA Cisplatin versus 5.1 months for the combination Gemcitabine Cisplatin (95% CI = 27.3 - 33.9) for the combination ALIMTA Cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI = 25,0 - 31.4) for the combination Gemcitabine Cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2507">In the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the Alli study in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, weight loss could not be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots on anus, flatus (winch) with stuhwork, stool strand, greasy / oily chair, down oily secretion (fences), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in graft patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for the weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypotheorical, greasy diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and young people under 18, as there are insufficient data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only absorbed minimal, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich individual meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancies in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (Internationally ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the levels of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take supplementary multivitamin preparations prior to bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">A marginal decline in Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and coincide with the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of reported side effects, detected after the market launch of orlistat, is not known as these events were reported voluntarily by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to ejaculations in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The majority of reported cases of orlistat overdosing were either reported to have no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the lipemic properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect takes place in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin rest of the gastric and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Derived from clinical studies, 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, has blocked absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day in combination with a hypotheorical, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight versus the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those participating in study, who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin amounted to 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">Average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and with a placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat could not be measured 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">In general, not metabolized orlistat in the plasma could be used sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients administered as a minimal systemically absorbed dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed varnishes) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl leucine-group) were identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenous potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular threat to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an anti-emetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is insufficient information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in case of strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute ion should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is required at the same time as palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is prolonged or that tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi should not be used in the days of chemotherapy, nor for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C) did not inhibit tumor activity.</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-State- Concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, CYP2D6 inductors (dexamoxicone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, chlorpromazine, Cimetidine, docxorubicin, pinidine, ranitidine, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on the application of Palonosetron for human pregnancy does not occur, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least might be related to Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the date of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out. however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective treatment for an alopox- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients who received a moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg. Dolasetron (half-life time 7,3 hours) received intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron received intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials of indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels in the ventricular de- and replicarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the ECG-effects of I.V. administered palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Following intravenous administration, an initial decrease in plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination of the body with an average terminale half-life time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to the equivalent level measured after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after one-off dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and around 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor in comparison with Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolisation showed that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unmodified ingredient made out about 40% of the given dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a unique intravenous bolus injection in healthy dogs the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Though, in patients with severe liver function disorders, the terminal elimination sentence and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposure that is considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 of the preclinical studies indicated that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations which are involved in ventricular de- and replicarisation and prolonging the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is intended for a unique application in humans, the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the prescription of the approval for the placing of the medicine prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by viral infections).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue damage the liver tissue. furthermore, the values of the liver enzyme alanine amine-ferase (ALT) are abnormal in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which stimulates this to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon, the manufacturer of alpheon, presented data to the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active substance structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study in patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was adopted (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the medicines to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C related to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting up the treatment with Alpheon, the disease rose again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study investigates the question as to what extent the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crustal) and small infected infirmations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that were demonstrable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because of this type of infection may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18 the skin surface to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was bleached at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin lesions, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in Hautwunden, approximately 90% of patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (eiterfilled cavities in the body tissues) or infections that were demonstrable or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse event associated with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of altargo in short-term treatment outweigh the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small hospitals, abrasions, or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for placing altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds, the efficacy of reapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical drugs on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on abrasive skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the simultaneous oral gift of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on Slow skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical Retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in terms of a statement affecting the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding should continue / stop or continue the therapy with altargo, the benefits of breastfeeding are to be considered for the infant and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, the most frequently reported side effect was irritation at the date of administration, which concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckeranus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of reapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the binding site of the ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptidyląg centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, partly blocking P-binding interacting and prevents the normal education of active 50s-ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of reapamulin may appear questionable at least some forms of infection, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were found in the in-vitro activity of retinosulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under the occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medicalation and children between 0-12 hours after the final application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1% salve on 200 cm2 smeared skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP-inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomites was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with minor participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were indications of adaptive liver and thyroid disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro examination on genetic mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats-microkernel test for in-vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application to 200 cm2 smeared skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3-times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacogilance system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (Version 6.1), works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the marketing authorisation is committed to carrying out detailed studies and additional pharmacogilance activities in the Pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management System for medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP should simultaneously be submitted with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area will show you to terminate the application of Altargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice in case of discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic wrap, which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambient lighting is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can lead to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defence of the body), "as it can resist a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccines that have been approved since 1996 and the vaccines that have been approved since 1997, and the vaccines that have been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered within the framework of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults have also been used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of ambient temperature was similar in a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substances, one of the other components, or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a permit for the aviation of Ambirix all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the primmmmisation with Ambirix is made up of two doses, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccine is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B-surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HV) antibodies were the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to a Hepatitis Avaccination should need a refresher as protection since it may also be protected from immunological memory with no more demonstrable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the classification scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, containing 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value after the priming process, so that additional vaccination doses may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal implication, these injection paths should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in cases of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix may be injected subcutaneous as an exception, as in these cases it can result in hemorrhage after intramuscular injection.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtherious, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and haemophilus-type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mummy mumps vaccine, the immune response was adequate to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, fatigue, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever was comparable to the incidence observed in earlier thiomersal- and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccinations have been administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged between 12 and including 15 years, Ambirix tolerability was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per Vaccine Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed in 50.7% of subjects after receiving Ambirix, compared with 39.1% in subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle 66,4% of the subjects had received Ambirix, about pain, compared to 63.8% in subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of suitability was comparable to a proband (i.e. about the entire vaccine at 39.6% of subjects who received ambient atmosphere compared to 36.2% in subjects who received the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and fatigue was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses-vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccine, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines, which reported severe side effects during the 2-doses-vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses-vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years, serum conversions for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The anti-HBs seroconversion rates were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, the month 6 administered dose (i.e. month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was valuable, the serum levels of serum (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the addition of the 3-dose implant significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses obtained in a clinical comparative study of 1-11-year-old one month after the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7) have been reported in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-doses-scheme with Ambirix or a 3-doses-vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of prioritization between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response against both antigens observed in this study was comparable to those found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- to including 15-year-olds it could be demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-12 months vaccine is comparable to that in the 0-12 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambirix was administered at the same time with the refresher of a combined diphtherious, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 haemophilus-type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar Seroprotection and Seroconversion rates similar to previous formulations for the present formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the re-encyclopedia on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not completely protect from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before serving the two doses of vaccination, vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be caused by itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If an allergic reaction has occurred with you / your child, an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B has occurred. • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usual administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">In case of a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / she recommends 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vaccine against completion of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected in people who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's defense / or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated / has been injected recently or has received immunoglobulins (antibodies) or is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as various limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambient temperature is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Typically, Ambirix does not administer pregnant or breastfeeding women, except it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic) in your child / child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data that have become known since the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP opinion that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only brought into circulation in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited because of the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Amonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with complete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Amonaps is divided into several single boxes at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a gastrostomy hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">This was not a comparative study, since Ammonsoon could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo (a pseudo medication, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Amonaps can also result in loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or flavor enhancements, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonsoon was approved under "exceptional circumstances," due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval, limited information on this drug was available.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzymatic deficiency is already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late maniac form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for the use when a hyperammonia encephalopathy exists in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">For patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency should be arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the emergence of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenyl butyrate over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during lactation period is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed to not be associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">An improbable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient, who developed metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactate dosis, severe hypocalcium, armordium, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound, which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be believed to produce sodium phenylbutyrate for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infused, and the disease itself led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemodialysis, the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen precipitation (sodium phenyl butyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn babies at postpartal (but within the first month of life) to increase to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a late maniacal form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornithintranscarbamylase deficiency) recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenyl butyrate and a protein-reduced diet were 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatically with glutamine, where phenylacetylglutamine is formed.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by an individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in a sober healthy adult and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis after individual release as well as repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an orally single dose of 5 g sodium phenyl butyrate in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were observed 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea fatigue or haemoglobin, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in plasma in the morning after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenyl butyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma gas were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the Micronucleus test results, sodium phenylbutyrate had no adverse effects in rats treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who do not yet swallow tablets, or given patients with swallowing disorders) or via a Gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">For patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed to phenylbutyrate (active metabolite by phenylbutyrat) before the birth of phenylbutyrate, lesions were found in the pyramid cells of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">An improbable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient, who developed metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactate dosis, severe hypocalcium, armordium, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Cycloometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an orally single dose of 5 g sodium phenyl butyrate in granulate form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were observed 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the mean measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS since sodium phenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription medicines.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), for example in case of unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress uplift" (an anomalous measured value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiomox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in sole administration or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During PCI the patient was often used a stent (a short tube left in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots like Abciaximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without GPI administration - was as effective in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as much as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, angiomox in relation to all indicators was just as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiomox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to biopsy rudine, other hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that angiomox is an acceptable replacement for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the placement of angiomox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST-birth infarction) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another row, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose can be resumed from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An injection of 0.5 mg / kg was administered immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolus release of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent IV infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus-administration of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI-intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully blended prior to the application and the bolus dose can be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal insufficiency (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bias against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in the III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT-value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bialirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in patients with dialysis, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox may be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous administration of fractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• severe uncontrolled hypertonia and / or irreversible coagulation disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertonia and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis-related patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivaliant is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although most haemorrhages on arterial points occur in PCI-patients among bivalirudine, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur everywhere during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">For patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, monitoring the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with biopsy rudine again reaches the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregators), these substances can be assumed to increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">The combination of biopsy specimens with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants are the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters in each case to be checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin were more common in women as well as for patients over 65 years more often than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleedings were defined in accordance with ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleedings as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleedings were significantly less common among bialibrines than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Biometdrudin plus GPIIb / III- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the area, which required radiological or surgical intervention, reduced haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding area, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding-localizations occurring at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" points of exception, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Biometrudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin were more common in women as well as for patients over 65 years more often than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleedings were significantly less common among bivalirudine than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system organclasses in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with Biometrudin is immediately canceled and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivaliant, a direct and specific platelet inhibitor, which binds both the catalytic center and the anionic acid region of Thrombin regardless of whether thrombosis is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of biopsy rudin to thromboin, and therewith its effect, is reversible because thromboin in its part slowly splits the binding of Biometrudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, a bivaliant with serum from patients in which thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) had come to induce no thrombocyte aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Biometrudin shows a dose-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is evidenced by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed on the following PCI, an additional Bolus of 0.5mg / kg of bivaliant should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, fractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-curing infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the onset of angiography (at the time of randomization) or with the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients requiring angiography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple points of a randomised double blind study with over 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudine were evaluated in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Bivaliant as peptide is expected to pass a catabolism into its amino acid components with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabot that results from splitting the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by thromboin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination occurs in patients with normal kidney function after a first order process with a terminological half-life time of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes needing treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a perfusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to control glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or that insulin is not effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was investigated in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot effectively operate insulin, Apidra has been studied in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin trap.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to insulin-lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the stomach-bridge.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced amount of glucose and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in effect, the brand (producer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delay etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can lead to a change in insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or the termination of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The change of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of the occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the effect of the used insulin and can therefore change during the treatment process.</seg>
<seg id="2983">These include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, sympathy analogues such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and reserpine may be weakened or absent from the symptoms of adrenergic antagonism.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and humanoids in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the Grade 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; frequently: ≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 1000; not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cold and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophies Will miss to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, resulting in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias involving loss of consciousness can be treated by a doctor using intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), or by intravenous injection of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucite injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal muscle and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs more quickly and the duration of action is shorter than with cou- and normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes ml- tus insulin lulisin showed a dose of proportional glucose concentration of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucose concentration effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the total glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a similar post-dendendal glycaemic control is reached like with a human regular insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was dug in 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-dendenial control was achieved than with a human regular insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is applied in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, similar glycaemic control is achieved as with a human regular insulin, which is given 2 times before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal was given prior to the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as in comparison to human regular insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-lulisin at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Normal-insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
