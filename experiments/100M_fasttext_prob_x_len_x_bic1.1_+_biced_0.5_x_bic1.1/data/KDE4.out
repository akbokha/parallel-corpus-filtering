package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , by making them more readily available .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Set@@ ting Settings ... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click on extras crashes . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available .
the module View filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with Tools View filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : document@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View is to display ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily recognized when it is far down in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have useful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over to color mode , can display either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property , such as the name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can determine whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or if the area is to be used by sub @-@ ordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles .
in case of representation algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the item . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always maintained .
how partition the area of an entry takes place for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames , that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minim@@ ally represented area for an entry via the menu entry View An@@ alog at area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the picture gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the picture gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can specify the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery in a text box .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a rot@@ ational field to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each row in the gallery .
display the file name of the image with the check box file name of the image to see if the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .
with the check box file size of the image , you determine whether the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the check box image size , you determine whether the size of the images is displayed below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the Save in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page .
with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set a sli@@ der or a script to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original pictures with the check box , whether the original images should be copied to the gallery .
using the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images than in the original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML @-@ settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you can find the media playback for the navigation area in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under window navigation pane or with the key symbol F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
changing browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , where you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Moz@@ illa / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse access with browsers on the basis of Moz@@ illa . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - Use elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the set @-@ in browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
by setting up the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information on the browser and the operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and instantly download your photos . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each media and card reader that is supported by your OS will work with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ code ; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or the lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam , an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
if you are in the program , the Help menu contains one entry issues or wishes to report .... This will open a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the bug report system . all necessary information is entered here . follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam site , visit the homepage to find news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get involved and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to log in in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam .
when you start &amp; edit ; for the first time you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data collection is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want to add . &amp; digi@@ kam , you will also use as an old library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; see every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ kam , thir@@ sting recur@@ sively the library path across its depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless you paste it in hidden folders . you can do this by setting a dot in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ kl@@ ist do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ words to manage your photos in the albums .
resource support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can &amp; digi@@ plug ; possibly also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Support .
how to set this up and work with raw files is described in the R@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder Pre@@ ferences and R@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and instantly download your photos . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each media and card reader that is supported by your OS will work with &amp; digi@@ plug .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is often used as a disk drive unit . the camera can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) under certain circumstances .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which has an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions over the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might see thumb@@ nail images or the creation might be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to digi@@ plug is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ IP album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to make the modules available to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to complement one function , as the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed , you can configure in the dialog box settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ i@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they are stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date when the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose the album Im@@ ported images to scan . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
in order to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the picture with the mouse to the target album and drop it down . in the then appearing menu , you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you must right @-@ click on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos when you choose to add or delete collection from the tool@@ bar collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
album Date : used if you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
the oldest , average , New Year buttons : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . this first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file in this folder will be used instead .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ i@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; Add as album preview quot ; In addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left bottom of the main window . album collections always include all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a short while , while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this in which you can recre@@ ate all preview images in the Tools menu .
information on each image will be shown below the previ@@ ew@@ ed thumb@@ nail . what information this is can be edited by editing Settings ; set up the albums site and adjust the preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help buttons , which appear . if you leave the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor a moment over an image . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduc@@ tory section of the main window displays such help window .
photos are all about &amp; digi@@ plug ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image Edi@@ ting shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can access all the functions that are with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by calling either F@@ 4 Picture Edi@@ ting ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... you can find a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ cam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by checking the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . for this , and how you customize it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . this information is lost from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to right @-@ click the preview and select rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can right @-@ click the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ mi@@ stre@@ quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again .
when a keyword is selected , all photos that have been selected with this keyword will be shown .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold sections of the tree &amp; quot ; My stu@@ b &amp; quot ; My stu@@ ffed monkey collection , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this will become the sub@@ set of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu will appear that gives you the opportunity to post@@ p@@ one the keyword .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and set it in the context menu as the album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; drag and drop there . alternatively , you can also click on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the words assigned to it . in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event at which it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keyword , this will appear in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and remove from the pop @-@ up menu Rem@@ ove from the menu . the menu only shows the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline display shows a time @-@ depend@@ able hist@@ ogra@@ m of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved by this hist@@ ogra@@ m . to select a time frame you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the box , which indicates the time unit .
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
the search box is a small lamp that becomes green when finding matches . if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the light will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as search criteria .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results are used in the View My search list in the main window . the text field Save Search is used to make your request a name in My search list . if you want to change your selection after the search , you just need to select the appropriate entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you choose to edit searches , the search form will appear with the search information entered before . if you choose to edit as advanced search , the search will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Clear in the context menu search .
the Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ plug ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted from it . each option can be associated with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ kam ; each image is characterized by a long number using a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar . if you move an image from anywhere on the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it down there .
sketch : free hand color sketches : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right images . also here , a threshold value can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive map finder based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or move it and move it . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the box below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , also raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The light table add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens .
from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select Pre@@ view syn@@ cing from the tool@@ bar and perform zoo and move operations on one of the images , then you can compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly order from a series of pictures . if you navigate pair @-@ wise navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right @-@ hand area . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures to work through .
of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swi@@ vel the visible area of the picture , you must click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview , both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ knob under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect , and use photos again . we focus on the processes for digital fot@@ ograph@@ ers that &amp; digi@@ kam , use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , secure , evaluate , grant , maintain , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management assumes , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , converts , assem@@ bles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need no longer to find a specific photo without stock management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to save the metadata both in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements , such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work sequences , constant access of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend storing the metadata option in the Settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam , to activate . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the relevant point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what &apos;s going to change ? to do this , &amp; digi@@ kam , provides them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now assign key words , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the further work .
let &apos;s talk with keywords , keyword , as you frequently call other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ plug ; automatically set the tree for you to paste the images in the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam , while it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the graph shows how different metadata is overl@@ apped . this is a very crude representation , since each block of metadata is in truth out of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to lab@@ eling or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos only , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closely , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ ute ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! one starts to dream , have associations , memories , the historical time span is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a cap@@ tion for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of images . if you export your images in web galleries , these cap@@ tions will be exported to your specifications in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation now starts with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will be even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels through images with Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , i.e. also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setting page of &amp; digi@@ kam means to be deposited as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and writer ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be filled in as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that offers the image to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator can delete or change this , embedded in the image . for individuals , this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can become un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age them by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles among CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . you should also read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives for this topic : disk study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT &apos;s errors announce the imminent failure . this is especially reading errors and tran@@ shipment counters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power loss before you have saved the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems .
this can cause serious damage on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed process processors . these can cause serious damage on your computer , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed motherboard and other defects . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in connector . remember , however , that not each connector also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers provide a surge shock , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically supply battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to save your data and run down the system . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W U@@ PS you can pay for less than &amp; euro ; 40 .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that lets you store any amount of data .
they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suited as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1@@ GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned up thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies , a backup and a distributed memory are included in the offer .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in your computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures at least the data integrity of the operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these mal@@ functions remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have lost a photo to your surprise . it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes a year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet a part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . for not@@ ebooks , the share of the@@ fts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage than e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most popular file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are located 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural barrier for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ated . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk is now responsible for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make every day your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes you luck if the drive wasn &apos;t connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crash : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous enough for your data . they normally affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above , a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of the files that have been really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ss@@ h .
back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other visual medium .
this approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
themes : metadata , stored in the image file , IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , maintaining original memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , using the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in , because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider everything that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other option than letting go of a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and you want to increase the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated plate or partition . in * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of the drive if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create them yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
P@@ NG is a los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that it has relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression .
TI@@ FF is widely used as picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open portrait format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and required to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; Technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive a copy of your photo , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits this as it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include the work on the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard compounds and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for fin@@ er editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images back with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs under certain circumstances .
use the edited pic@@ s for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them to web galleries , en@@ code them in m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. see adding a photo to an album you will find a description on how to add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and switch it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ ent indicator appears at the bottom end and the preview images of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the lateral bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the metadata display shows the internal metadata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer remark , GPS , etc. of the picture . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam , and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones using the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , you can download the download button and download Sel@@ ected .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you download the Find All or download selection buttons , a dialog appears that lets you select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of the existing albums is displayed , like normal folders sorted . then select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam , load the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete some , you must select them first and then delete the selected deleted .
note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded to a &amp; digi@@ code album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera file completely , you should do this via the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally recycled after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can result in dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos from different recording series to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day .
the first two relate the data to the author in the Standard Car Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want another date format than standard format , e.g. in the edit field , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the option date &amp; time to add . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters , or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; can use any information on camera orientation at the time of recording to perform automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is normally turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver that information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the lower area of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date that the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam , this use to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the page header Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally turned off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ kam , the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option on . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based cal@@ ming option at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam , you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder cho@@ oser dialog for the camera will appear . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in length and width gra@@ ding and which can be displayed on a map . data analysis can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users want to send a postcard to a different &amp; digi@@ plug ; or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that there are many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ ch@@ ords , and map references . the question is actually more about how data flows into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a follow @-@ up of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic mapping ( manual ) and last about manual entry of known sites .
as far as we know there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a couple working with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ or or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are several programs for Windows and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pr@@ elo@@ aded coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to give you as much control over its workflow as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to select Settings . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be displayed on embedded thumb@@ nail or image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam , fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . even in case of database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC data fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . this can be names such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to specify the one that offers the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the image other &amp; quot ; an@@ biet@@ a quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC acts store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fel@@ der@@ s.@@ This ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the &amp; digi@@ kam database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported and edited without being lost .
save image cap@@ tions as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the page Settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor rests on a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the settings of the brightness of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , if you then open the LED , these settings if enabled . however , some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast computers . if you have one then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are set here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ scription it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TI@@ FF file option , you can turn the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect image quality , because the Def@@ late algorithm works without loss .
with setting los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . as this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only one image viewer for photos . at present , it is rapidly becoming a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing .
the default is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react when sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . this option records the image a little soft but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard , it is a solid color balance that is based on a white card photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the pointed @-@ out , so the parts of your images that are burned @-@ in are to see the pointed @-@ lights in the settings because of the inability of your camera to look at the pointed @-@ lights . the setting colors will generate some unusual results , since they show the pointed @-@ lights in various ro@@ at@@ balls .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struction option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should be individually adjusted for each image .
put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the frame options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing . to keep the time for the demo @-@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color @-@ filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which a matrix of coloured pixels is available . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; and D@@ cra@@ w make three alternatives available : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ated Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction , as it is performed during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam . information such as colour information from one color space to translate into the other is thus the colors as accurate as possible .
behaviour Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files start .
color Profile Fol@@ der Sets you to the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam , examine this folder during startup .
settings of the ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ bre or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon which do not contain any color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to carry out the color @-@ mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors may therefore seem very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension allows you to recognize the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ plug ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and they will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the previ@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short instructions for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quick commands &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the sli@@ der settings should be easy to understand . the upper sli@@ der adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes turn the metadata inside or out , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera properties on the left side show a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic recognition that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer , and if you want to use it , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on , and in the image display mode .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you can mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you must connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera detects automatically . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can choose any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash b@@ ins , you can see the dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam , set in an album when del@@ eting a photo . in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album , you will find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ kam , if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without re @-@ en@@ quiries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the knob chan@@ ts .
you can also display the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ plug ; while star@@ ing , it may speed up &amp; digi@@ plug the startup process .
the setting Bei@@ m Start looking for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam , to look for the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ kam , you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam , used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar settings in settings design . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; edit ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the entry / editing context menu .
image Edi@@ ting contains a set of tools to improve your images . some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you cannot recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your picture before you change it . you can save it with file Save As .
as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button from the File Rest@@ ore button or the Rest@@ ore button Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you will then loose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last save .
almost every action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by modi@@ fying or recre@@ ating Edi@@ ting from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB on the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are revers@@ ed or restored in between .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword , using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , down picture , or using the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ large factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen . you come to the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c button . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want this , you can change it in the editing dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sets . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select the printer wiz@@ ard from the Album Ex@@ ports menu . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also available in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions .
after you have commented , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
besides the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the coding will follow the scheme in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword @-@ tree and a selection box with the keywords applied previously in this &amp; digi@@ code session .
the keyword @-@ tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword . you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords for a series of pictures . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these are stored for fast access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC keyword keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword @-@ tree , this is applied only to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word Fil@@ l section .
the side bar Key@@ word Fil@@ ters is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop words . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword has already existed , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection .
in the above example the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword @-@ tree has been drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be turned off under settings Differ@@ ent .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key term , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an advanced search across all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options see then as follows :
why didn &apos;t Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not be listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam , s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that you have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual or sc@@ anned colors from your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish on the web that matches your digital dark@@ room .
when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means you make informed choices at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make sure you make informed choices about color management .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image issues are e @-@ mail or web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB means that your ; on@@ itor works on s@@ RGB , then you must either cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , synchron@@ ize , automatic synchron@@ ization and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection attempt automatically from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which is best at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the Leu@@ st@@ coefficient values over the entire image , leaving the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed away .
ab@@ ase : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ous factor of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes , the comparing is very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue can@@ als to the entire hist@@ ogra@@ m range .
extending Con@@ trast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible with well @-@ washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited since using a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they run it over the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be customized in size . on the left side , both the original image and preview of the target image can be seen . preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window to click .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
right up , a hist@@ ogra@@ m is shown that will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well lit images that have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment allows you to improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the Pre@@ ferences list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . any setting of the white balance you set can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save these settings , your original image will be changed .
you can set the coding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour @-@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the Color Administration chapter .
another important tool is to find tone correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use them for several photos at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for ton@@ ing correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation that you will find in colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug @-@ tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in the period of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when using a partially developed pressure from a short flash light and subsequently inver@@ ted the development of the image . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial neg@@ atives of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment creates a negative image that cannot be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors bril@@ li@@ antly and glow . try it , it embell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large pictures , the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can view the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for reducing satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you perform can be seen in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple rej@@ ecting / contrast / G@@ amma , the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slide for the application described here . concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three slides are cli@@ cked in and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the knob and watch how the picture changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . previ@@ ew@@ ing is dynamic , with the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set the hist@@ ogra@@ m with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is often dominated by a single column . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controllers : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lower for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three colour pin@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a knob for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a burnt image as background while something else is visible in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is read@@ ju@@ sted automatically for all shadows , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the hist@@ ogra@@ m input for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to detect over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
the left side displays half of the original and the target image . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most sensible . for pictures with large areas of constant color , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic mode will continue to help .
for example , if you move a short piece to the right , e.g. the light tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker pron@@ oun@@ cements and that the corresponding image pixels are darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to shift this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly that . each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
select the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance canal . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color gra@@ dations of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the colors of the images . you can edit it from the Color channel mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and rash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m appears to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are below : control for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you also activate the color components . this is especially convenient if you also activate the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , as the channel mixer then is THE tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of color leads to a visible noise coming from the ey@@ eb@@ row . color @-@ like consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you first reduce the color .
save and load buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved and loaded for later use . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to detect over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , because color pictures can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

green Fil@@ ters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red l@@ enti@@ l filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ ano : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the att@@ un@@ es . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and the re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ der@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , stit@@ ch an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping an observer &apos;s eye on the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your picture . lined with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce bor@@ dered it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , it surrounds it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a knock effect and decorative trim adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specify the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the pattern decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text into one image at any position . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press OK button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can &apos;t be changed any more .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool template can apply a template over an image .
the menu image Tem@@ plate applied in image editing can be used to lay templates on a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ code ; template file digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button Basic Fol@@ der in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the template files . these settings are scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder was set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the template bar of the templates .
below is a preview of three buttons that can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge This button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button will shrink the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
shift : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but it generates gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture blur@@ red . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digital@@ ised images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process has to sum up colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this , in turn , results in sharp edges a little blur@@ red . SL@@ R cameras usually need more later sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for home users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharp@@ ness . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a field of focus while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ er Archi@@ ving .
but you should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you will achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise Soft drawing and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in radius or amount intensi@@ fies the effect . if you make the blur@@ ring mask to strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the apply difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter . this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the shar@@ per and therefore beauty mistakes in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected de@@ f@@ ection filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese filtration . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blu@@ r mask . re@@ focusing achieves mostly better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by calling colors to focus in image processing .
the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s folding is even very strongly influenced by the removed pixels . it causes un@@ desirable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should yield 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , eg , the image quality is very bad .
this is most often caused by a previously executed blur@@ ring filter . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter .
die size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge . note however that the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Char@@ ging buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity corrections in the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that much surgery changes that are not immediately visible , but leave unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , eg , than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ieren produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the Un@@ sharp Mas@@ king using a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theoretically , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ king must always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused picture :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the controller smoo@@ thes the blu@@ r of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ ting allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the Ri@@ der smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoo@@ thing over the picture . whereas larger values are mainly smoo@@ thed in homogen@@ ous regions and details are sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be preserved in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary . please note that the detail conservation should always be subject to directional dependence .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions , while a value is smoo@@ thed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD noise will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ step @-@ ampl@@ itude da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you get by choosing this option is minimal . it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to let it out .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
corrected image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the abor@@ tion button .
below you can see how to remove image fla@@ ws with Small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see , there is a unique black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by poor movie reloc@@ ation during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced settings can remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors corrected .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details , and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy of the filter . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong you can &apos;t remove all the noise or noise peaks . set it to a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a faint noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically more smo@@ ke@@ able .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter atten@@ uation . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther , if it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear on the edges .
save under and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . noise reduction has been applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise Soft drawing and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ ating .
below you can cut like a photo with uni@@ formity noise reduction .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , textures are reduced to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows image pixels of photos that have been removed with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ P@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard by button Dark@@ Picture . the tool will auto @-@ detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the corrected image . an auto @-@ processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and a long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blu@@ r effects are caused by movement .
it is possible to simulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter with the large exposure range of today &apos;s film and color or gray area depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction turns the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regi@@ men you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is equivalent to an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly of a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / G@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sph@@ erical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar ro@@ unding effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the remote corners towards that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , t@@ onal distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth gra@@ dient . this value appears more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the opposite character of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ ets the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bri@@ gh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog illustrates the distortion corrections . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the t@@ onal or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all blan@@ king or size changes . best perform this correction first . if you cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ne correction , the effect would be obvious .
to help you find the best correction you can provide this tool a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the cur@@ sor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Trans@@ form Edit menu or via the zoom knob of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs , such as shots from the front , frame and paintings is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of simul@@ ating the Infr@@ ared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO @-@ Regul@@ ator changes the amount of film grains and the domin@@ ance of green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce inf@@ ra @-@ red film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter image applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Fil@@ tr@@ ation Filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gran@@ ulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are often required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gran@@ ulation effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , from the other side seen , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel big picture is 1 and smoo@@ thed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage model . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Be@@ ating .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blu@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharpen@@ ed : blur@@ red the image along star shaped lines that radi@@ ate from one point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera .
sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by a random shift of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
smart blur@@ ring : finds the paint tank in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button termin@@ ating .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this makes it natural to your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow along with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the visual effect of drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing to hold a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain drops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the painted image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirr@@ oring or rotating in the right direction . you can find the tools in the Trans@@ forming Tur@@ ning or Trans@@ forming M@@ irr@@ ors menu .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of picture quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose Trans@@ form size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ kam , uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
maintaining aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the original image aspect ratio will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used for this purpose . each inser@@ tion for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ ating .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles when a small color image has been enlarged to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together an image . to cut a photo you have to create with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut away . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be covered by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply drawing with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ tr@@ l button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) .
in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog stays with it .
in the tool after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in the portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can see , for example , a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically centre the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool next time , these settings will be displayed as standard values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the sett@@ ling help make it possible to blend aids , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmonious tri@@ angles : harmonious tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third angels , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden mean is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful .
the golden partition is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean .
the golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the observer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that distra@@ cts the eye into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the above discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that unlike harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als can be placed more dynamic on these lines .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
the Horizon@@ tal reflect and vertical options can be used to reflect the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current picture .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
if you do a photo , it is easy that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose Trans@@ forming free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can reset the slide to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window .
for your help , the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the cur@@ sor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
once you have turned a picture you will find un@@ desirable triangle holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming cutting out of image processing .
an elegant way to crop the image is the Automati@@ cally Cut function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image slightly after turning . note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle on the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle on the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly lubri@@ cated . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double the effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with trans@@ formations cut out of image processing .
the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . for example , the upper part of the image is shifted to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not rotation , the image is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press forward pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview area .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the she@@ ar , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two she@@ ings generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is to cut the image with trans@@ formations cut out of image processing .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; edit ; shows only files in formats to which you know . this is done on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam , the file in image editing is displayed .
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supporting the loading of blank images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ kam . all support cameras can be seen below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that can be edited by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in capabilities to display films or edit them . if you click on a film file &amp; digi@@ kam , use the &amp; k@@ de ; use Settings to play movies to start playing .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam , included . your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , plasti@@ ci@@ zing , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture app@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the state of the filter on the current picture . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally split without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are marked .
the properties tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map finder based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or move it and move it . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot Custom Color and Rec@@ ently used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the palette . here , the color @-@ name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is enabled under the color button , the color will be inserted from the color chart on the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different one ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing was selected . this mode can be set by selecting the tick box over@@ writing under the cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used along with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut , and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line mark , if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , are out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; -@@ project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Graphi@@ c . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; ards ; re@@ comp@@ uted the graph and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; ards ; to open or to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph . you need in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you run &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like at the bottom of the screen :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction in a graph .
if the file is currently edited by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can also remember that later . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings ...
if you want to open a Graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change them with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice of both saved and later .
you can also specify how to divide the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be selected freely .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which come to a page , should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Renew@@ ed Store site gives the option to determine the behavior if a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time is requested .
the session management page gives the option to set the startup behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at any start .
the context menu , which normally appears on a single click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge cross@@ ings as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ linear graphs . it produces representations according to the spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring model layout for un@@ coated graphs . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ tice for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides images to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images of a scanner that supports the SA@@ NE project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
when you scan the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by setting the default ab@@ r@@ he standard values to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the Scan@@ nen button . the estimated file size will show you in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings might not be shown otherwise .
after you have pressed the button scan you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the Im@@ por@@ table &gt; screen shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select Complete Desktop to read a single window below the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible place . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen shot is made , the dialog box appears with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo administration on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r is able to show his photos to the people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , place photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token , which is used for your authentication . it is virtually your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started to enable you to log in with Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Website . the following page will be presented following a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking Yes , you will see the dialog for up@@ loading photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . at present , you need not any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button Add images should be pressed once you set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server starts .
the Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the option to change the size of the photos before upload , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered by Maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the geographic location K@@ IP@@ I allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographic loc@@ alization module provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sph@@ erical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ ati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization correlation . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to provide a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file , of course , contains data taken at the same places at the same locations as the pictures of your camera .
when the file loads an automatic correlation that shows coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . set your camera time zone here .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one location for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have matching data . if you know that in reality a location is in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . choose the region in question and enlarge it . always repeat this until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a Picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can choose the albums you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will en@@ code U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that should be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab shows the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option for each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the picture will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ,
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have read permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab preview images allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album Ri@@ der for preview images , which are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window will show the user how far the action is . press C@@ anc@@ el to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . press En@@ closure to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and tricks . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is rising , since there is no compression of the color information . this can be found in the P@@ NG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the destination image .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check i@@ Vi@@ v2 , to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coding Engine is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ J@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a basic image transfer . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you must select the corresponding PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds the image is displayed . the speed of the image transition is set below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you provide an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . once you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie with the button Co@@ ding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show once you are back .
if an indication appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ J@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings right down .
the printer wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing Gim@@ p . this is for example : make sense to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file which is to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
Tag@@ ged Image format , TI@@ FF , retains all information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them otherwise you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ ride existing file automatically . however , this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all the images in an album . it uses the convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 d@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you pres@@ upp@@ ose . you can add more images through the button Add images . for the last selected image , a preview is shown on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to be sent .
removing images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client by clicking OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are attached as attachments .
don &apos;t forget to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of emails sent . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is done , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . by closing the closing button , you can close this window .
after starting the module advanced slide show , a window with questions like you want to show your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL transitions option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Name option allows the file name of the images to be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly choose that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
the time gap between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose . random@@ ly select another effect in each transition between the images .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the left lower edge of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date is currently no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have marked your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; by these browsers , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the image , are now present in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have submitted your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images .
if you click on the entry with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
when you select another person , only the images shown on which both individuals are displayed are displayed . this selection method allows you to limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to some single images .
if you have selected all people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nail images to view images from your area of action .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , that is of course also true for locations , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
in order to display images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to define which image is to be displayed for each individual . to do this , you must select the image @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . in the view window , you can adjust the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cli@@ pped .
when you access the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can preview this dialog once again .
if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you wish , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date may be either part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like reading manuals , but rather want to try some features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog if you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . you can see a picture of this bar here : . as the name implies , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
each bar displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview list ) and also the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; provides you with two options to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built @-@ in version that you can create via the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages you have to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and goal . in the following , each area is described more closely .
first enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ Photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages see an example of these settings .
next , choose if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created that is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer , even without description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . therefore , you can not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 will not download any images , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time that you have set . so , he can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image larger he switches to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
for all your HTML files , select a basic folder and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages are created , will start . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created aren &apos;t yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . to enable the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time recording the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; this work does not even make one more time .
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . they can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file themselves or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can join all the pictures and pass this file independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have provided when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the File Ex@@ ports menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
if you want to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally Cop@@ y to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Im@@ ports ... select , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the im@@ porting wiz@@ ard consists of four steps . first you have to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called persons in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories correspond to those in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the files to be imported using the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and look at pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look for example pictures of your Italian vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Speci@@ fying the information about your images , about ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , through ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top@@ most folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; remember the folder where your images are stored and automatically re @-@ use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album , then you can start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ Photo@@ album ; set up ... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings will be explained .
to the left , you can see six different symbols with which you can access the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access the F1 button and click on the desired option by pressing a button .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the dialog Options you can set up complete members groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group will be set up in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; share its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves .
since the modules of several applications are used together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; therefore , you should first test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures .
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums : there is an album just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; this kind of order doesn &apos;t support it simul@@ ates it for some modules the order to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album .
simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , that is , all images that show you the picture preview right now .
next to the current album &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album , the modules also have a list of albums . here goes and k@@ Photo@@ album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; so do , so if you had selected people to view it and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules that you want to load .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar on top of the tool@@ bar . at the moment , it does not contain a lot of information , as you do not yet have information about your images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; is the possibility to add any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , where the image is taken , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if illustrated on all pictures Jes@@ per and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , by that the names used are moved upwards , find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the icon for sorting after date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected pictures and add these images with notes . in this case , simply click the above and back buttons that are located on the right @-@ hand side of the picture .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the U.S. . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
in the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a hyper@@ tro@@ phy . to show you that it is a group , a special icon will appear .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry into a category and place it in order to make it an sub@@ category of this entry . note , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog by clicking and moving the l@@ ath that forms the upper edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers you , among other things , the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to get this window shown later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or of all pictures if you have no filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nail images by simply drawing the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete the Edit menu . now the window will show you that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use it with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; namely , you need to have the pictures stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you have to record the pictures somewhere , so &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures of which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 the preview images are available , so &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; so please don &apos;t support it to avoid inser@@ ting the CD in question . so , if you would like to avoid the mess of your images , please buy a larger hard disk to store all images on it .
in the pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures in such a way that in the end those who wish to make you in@@ accessible to others click on the menu entry All in addition to the current view .
with this you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images to be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply choose password change in the privacy menu .
please note that this image protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other , anyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text .
the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from previ@@ ew@@ ing as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he obviously shows the picture , but additional all the information you have about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see matching entries for this . if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image above and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can enter the image and zoom out . for zo@@ oming , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus key , you can zoom in again . the plus button zo@@ oms in to the center of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . by means of the par@@ ity button , you set the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out @-@ out with the plus and sub @-@ key .
with the turning functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
when you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set on the image . at the moment you can view the image ab@@ ort and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you may prefer to highlight just the image and look at more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you see one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this you see an image where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , they are available to you in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print , or whatever you have always selected , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can display categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature , after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can undo your painted later .
in the picture you can see a picture on the painted . to turn on the painting mode from &amp; photo album ; on the picture you can draw on the picture from the context menu . to end the painting press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully mastered , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub @-@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar , or select a menu entry in the Settings menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar to Edit , or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with a fault description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with ab@@ ort .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already includes the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in tag view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ design view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the point of view of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when selected , or their level of view smaller or equal to the point of view selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views to the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle will display the new position .
to create a new column , drag the connection to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views on top of each other , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the top of the flash@@ cards in the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the hit on the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the cham@@ fer bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
the current window view can be saved with the View window order ... Store . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering the icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry View Sc@@ ene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
when clicking on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender Mod@@ i menu , the following dialog is opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to use a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the cross section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in the combination field quality , you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection illumination . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel , different errors can arise . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , compu@@ te and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling describes the neighboring pixels with inclu@@ de@@ .The second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because each pixel is continuously split up and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be tra@@ cked separately and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that creating noise for the beam process called j@@ itter . if you turn on j@@ itter , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for the display of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; unexpectedly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import a Po@@ v@@ ray , select the menu entry File Im@@ ports ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet full command scope of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height @-@ field data ) in paths to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Li@@ br@@ aries . if you include files that are not in the folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type license plates .
you can set the object string of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
when you cross High Details on extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections . this property results in better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time to render .
when you tick the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you tick the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you activate Kan@@ ten@@ g@@ lät@@ tung , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used to render the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window instructions section explains how to create and store window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and selected views with the button removal .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you get a map view together with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black image .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tool@@ bar icons . please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you &apos;ll need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; start with a simple scene . to follow this instruction , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit del@@ e@@ tion menu .
the view of the scene from the view of the camera shows you the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the outcome of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the title camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera sees control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
when you press the App@@ ly button or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( inser@@ ting infinite body qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ design view now also shows the level , even at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : scale , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should shift the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog box opens in which you can choose how to insert the object . please choose first sub@@ object . the pigment will then be displayed in the property panel . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pigment preview only shows a matte black material , because you still have to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see color on ader and ball in preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . select the item color list in the object tree . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
each time you choose the object tree , select the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to perform this step as you have already understood the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the user button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course rendering is a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the screen@@ shots below and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
the shine effect and reflection settings are already partially good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal : not yet chosen :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that needs to be rendered will need some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
once you have saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ covers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved time are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you haven &apos;t saved any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the most recent command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Un@@ do .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new short instructions for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new ones .
open a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface separately and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel @-@ based , by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s , or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in an own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog Buil@@ der &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when operating the name of the last opened folder . at the next startup , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored bar to select a background color . it is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the picture in the window mode , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default setting is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der respectively the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cut for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .

&amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a more frequent user of &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ screen@@ .@@ In this mailing list however , English is spoken , you should be powerful this language .
the best start to take part in &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; .
&amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; try to give as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ screen@@ .@@ To access these settings , you need to select setting the settings dialog ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the exposure indicator , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to view . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ screen@@ .@@ has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; h@@ exag@@ onal ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes as images to scan and store .
&amp; h@@ ass@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that are no longer able to scan and save images . &amp; channels ; for each image , open a dialog for saving or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by typing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; output ; with the command h@@ ul@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog is opened to select the scanner .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; gu@@ inea ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options in particular .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and par@@ ak@@ y will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window .
through the button Settings , the same name dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; output ; images save them . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog in front of every sc@@ anned image . if &amp; output ; this automatically should be stored with a generated name in a pre @-@ defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without having to ask for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory , and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically to save images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored picture gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is counted up each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .

&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; use like all other short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and its function . the global short@@ cut can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and setting Global Tast@@ esp@@ ous@@ el ... selecting the right mouse button in the player window and setting short instructions ... select .
you can set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ short instructions . this will make your keyboard to &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Am@@ aro@@ k has many general functions that are usually found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , and scripts .
Am@@ aro@@ k supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Am@@ aro@@ k has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use k@@ Dialog , so the user knows why a script is not running .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ strip ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ ebo@@ x --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Am@@ aro@@ k and control Am@@ aro@@ k . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here an example in Python :
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; sends aler@@ ts to all current scripts . to do this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continually monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Am@@ aro@@ k sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information on the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le To Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry was cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ title are also used to remove the script from the d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ title ) .
before &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; closes , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to perform cleaning tasks such as storing data or configuration settings .
Am@@ aro@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the Er@@ sweeping Aqu@@ amar@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script pack@@ ets right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ las Page of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . you might even search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos; s Collec@@ tive Browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can &apos;t decide which one you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Am@@ aro@@ k has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . these and many more useful functions make Am@@ aro@@ k the most advanced audio player . Am@@ aro@@ k is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Am@@ aro@@ k sources to compile and install Am@@ aro@@ k :
da &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies need to be fulfilled so that they can be used . for details , see the System Requi@@ rements section .
enables de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , you should use full .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without trouble using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; .
in addition , if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this feature is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
vo@@ icing files to the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ Bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k should be started when a browser is required .
using other browsers , you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists when moving , the current playlist will automatically save when moving &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist in the end .
relative paths to manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , are stored . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , the playlist window will pop up / un@@ roll to keep the piece always visible in the visible window area .
when changing the context to the context browser , the context browser automatically displays as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust the look &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . by selecting Custom Writ@@ ing , the otherwise gray displayed section is activated . you can choose fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the source of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated , for foreground and background color .
resume play when starting , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it has been stopped at the end of the end .
set up on @-@ screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be shown in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors do not use , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users , allowing you to determine which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to insert how to proceed with the selected folders .
search for sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k to search both the selected as well as their sub@@ folders to music .
monitor Chan@@ ges : allows &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , incre@@ mental searches are performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k to add all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further device is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; under computer : enter the computer on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , it is entered under port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the card file last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and make music recommendations as needed regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can view the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Am@@ aro@@ k needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will , for example , prepare difficulties . we try to support Am@@ aro@@ k on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by typing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
usually this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k is somewhat more mature .
make sure all libraries used by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this will result in crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic . switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a info , but they do not mark the Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l : &quot; the file $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl @-@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be removed in grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ang@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ang@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Am@@ aro@@ k uses the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Am@@ aro@@ k will find the correct version first .
there are several ways . most installation problems are easiest to solve by means of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Am@@ aro@@ k .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to look for help . please insert only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Am@@ aro@@ k itself .
after the start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; only an empty playlist appears . how do you get music there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start sub@@ window has been converted to the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Am@@ aro@@ k 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Display Review . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the review for a piece . you can also use the short instructions Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Am@@ aro@@ k is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press de on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it down , just like you would do it with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the button playlist . click on it .
you probably miss the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none ! yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the real question must be : what type of media does G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 de@@ co@@ ders are included in the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat , mp3 k@@ de , input button
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device must provide a mixer . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA installation file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ ds _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less gir@@ th react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , drop &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . follow @-@ register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute list scripts , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all the m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with auto @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; .
if you have a complete list of suggestions , please send it to our mailing list : Am@@ aro@@ k @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command lets &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you wake up from the soft sounds of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get to know the current in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; current titles when you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command will give you interpre@@ ters and titles of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ User name Am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ window . push on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the paste button after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?

my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Am@@ aro@@ k , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Am@@ aro@@ k MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio @-@ CD in the menu . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , you instead take files from the folder mp3 or o@@ gg .

basically , this fits the previous assessment with a decreasing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can modify the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and editing : select or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata edit dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Am@@ aro@@ k . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that will not match the short @-@ term plan of Am@@ aro@@ k .
this is a new feature in Am@@ aro@@ k , which some users can find quite annoying . disable the option icon while playing in the General Settings .

Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password .
if you would like to use AL@@ SA then please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports .
probably , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Am@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new installed , but the output modules do not appear yet . and now ?
the same goes for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I am getting the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Am@@ aro@@ k .

I have a second sound@@ card and I use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Am@@ aro@@ k ?
setting up Am@@ aro@@ k settings ... Audio output enter the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setting dialog of x@@ ine , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , des@@ elect the sound card hooks to support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with arts is not being looked after . of course , you are welcome to take this problem yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new urgently needed advisor for arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is an instruc@@ tional wiz@@ ard that will appear at the first start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wiz@@ ard , this quick start guide will help you . with its help you will have set up &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection makes it easier for you to search for specific pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it by using the button playlist , save it . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , you will be able to view various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , select A@@ ctions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the playback button .

&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some additional packages are listed , which make work with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k easier .
if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; a player window with the most important features . in addition , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and Sam@@ pling rate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time to the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zer , even under the running text display . you can change through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button .
the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the Player window . click on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ der to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most developed playlist of all available for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that don &apos;t exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter you , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context @-@ browser displays different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ters . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , you may notice that the sub@@ window Start has dropped off . the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; furthermore , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window provides information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album .
the first area in this sub@@ window displays information on the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to look at the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information on the current piece . you see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats are supported by .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng . the context @-@ browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . when you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing right away . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using scripts written by itself . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if not yet a text script is running , you can choose which to be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . there is no running text script required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ing only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First , the pieces are sorted by artist and below will be a further split after the album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Vari@@ ous interpre@@ ters .
group Interpre@@ t / Jahr - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection will be sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be sorted by genre first and then by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing at will and combine .
with the last button you can change the settings for the collection . note : &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly below the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter is a selection box , with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can choose from various time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
loading - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry , you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This feature will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
for media players , add the pieces into the queue for transferring to the media player . see the section on the Media Player browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - this will send the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burn them either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not appear .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialogue for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move the files in the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among various interpre@@ ters .
undo collection marker - Chan@@ ges a recorded album back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be shown under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser is easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Smart Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
also created Smart Play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new Smart Play@@ list . there you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; Start , find the pieces on your iPod to performer sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this way the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the transfer is finished , stop &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
the tool bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not meet your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , you will find an address bar with which you can get music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simple dropping . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be useful : thus dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all the pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply entering the entries with the mouse to the desired position . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed . to reset the filter , press the button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter keywords separated by spaces , search &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you type one two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR 2 OR 3 . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three are found ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose bum@@ pers : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something does not contain something that does not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and then right @-@ click on the entries in the desired order . the entries will then receive a mark with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar flag in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . you can get the settings from &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k via this menu .
one click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; select .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information to &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . choose from :
the queue management got your big move into &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece to the queue , a number will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
you can easily manage the queu@@ es via Tools Service Long Management . if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ set ( the details to set up these will follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , adding more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to do this dynamic playlist .
double click on the playlist you want to play , drag them into the playlist window or right @-@ click on you and then select charging . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set pieces mix and playlist mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing right away . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces begin with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . via the same menu entry , dynamic mode can be de@@ activated again .
the New Fil@@ l button completes the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . editing play@@ lists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . after that , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a bit dou@@ bly in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed , taking into consideration the setting .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist according to each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog , you can choose from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . when you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; add random items from each of the selected play@@ lists .
some scripts enable their own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on Setup .
you can install new &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k scripts by clicking on the script . a selection dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ting section .
the dialog window Visu@@ alization plugin is used to activate the available Visu@@ al@@ isations in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box in which you can choose which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when re@@ coding to MP3 , you will get worse quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Cop@@ y CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have made all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog box that looks like this :
in this dialog window you can follow the progress of the copying process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the library search path ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS with your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback , access community help from the forums and get news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality for fired audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally called Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . it is , for example , possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ coder Module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ Ma@@ ger : a full @-@ featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
Norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the pieces of music play differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the related sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . clicking on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown , with which you can choose folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet been saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and making changes . furthermore , you can cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project to do with it , just as if you had called for any project file closing .
close all opened projects and end &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any un@@ saved project you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called C@@ lose file .
when you access this entry , you can select files for addition to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is the ? Help manual ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session will always be included , even if this feature is not used . it is meant for you rather than help to see the files and folders already existing on the media .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only hides the previously imported files .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively you can only create an image of a CD , which you can then burn later on . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows the copying of a DVD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record all the ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then immediately be burned by pressing the Bur@@ n button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burnt immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even possibilities to change the size and trim black edges .
this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is selected , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as Media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks pretty and dis@@ connects the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window for modi@@ fying key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature for it further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wiz@@ ard .
open the settings from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can make general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and fine @-@ adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and the type of your task is more important , which of the attached programs you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void Copyright C@@ d ( ) void format@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( ) void copy@@ rights ( )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ ter volume ID ( Q@@ string id )
thus it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T / home / tru@@ schi / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read@@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many coding files that en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( compressed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ ress into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or even in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ able ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ den@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ang any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setup only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily use to read a &amp; CD is explained . this ( hopefully ) will guide you to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which codes are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , with everything being recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . step by step , you will find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
the CD@@ DB will start the request of the CD @-@ data according to the creation of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the coding Settings tab in the setup directory - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , allowing the selection to be read with another en@@ coder as the default . it should be noted that before the en@@ coder was configured in the setup dialog in the setup dialog .
open the file manager , so an already read file is selected to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; quit ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; K@@ audio@@ Creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like en@@ coder , for setting up en@@ co@@ ders ) . here you must go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ den@@ ers and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are others such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly any commercially available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression according to their psycho@@ active model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate the differences become less important , since both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is delivered with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open licenses questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of teenagers , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without considering the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be passed / needed with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ coder explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; K@@ audio@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that you can download and enter the information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that here only the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I &apos;m not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information released publicly on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ per through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; actively select a check box ( sending one address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with a different ( fake ) address than the one in the system . in this kind of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the progra@@ mmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually made monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened .
to save the read wa@@ v files , the en@@ ame and the desired file format can be selected . first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the en@@ coder . other codes can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined en@@ co@@ ders . further information on Ko@@ di@@ erer is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a coder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio co@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something to the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; K@@ audio@@ Creator ; something that is probably done only once , and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each end &amp; CD ;
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are lazy , we share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any read@@ out of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name will be passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the true device name of your disk . if this does not work or if there is more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives can be used .
there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left as left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information can be selected , so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and file name will be changed with kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , you can continue to note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use this twice . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how do the system know which data the CD should get ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , but as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 as standard , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should be enough .
simply take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number at the same time : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; disc@@ ard the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must the path / folder be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something yourself with the wa@@ v files .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously encoding WAV files : with a dual score or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; K@@ audio@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk runs . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and want to fetch the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b .
since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data obtained for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; enter data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this sample is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , consult the FAQ section for the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; current title &apos; field , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; field , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what is &amp; audio creator ; this option is set on the tab settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see help to the Ko@@ di@@ ver to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the end @-@ to @-@ end CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not anyway forward the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org &apos;s website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when downloading the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the unit list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece into or out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the button All items selected at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
if the selection process is started by clicking the button Sel@@ ection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the Ri@@ der orders to turn on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will show you if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ ver that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been en@@ coded successfully are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . with this , read and coding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code .
now the last title is read out while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is in the queue of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; K@@ audio@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ ver of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the package multimedia from your distribution . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is directed to persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how to adjust the program to suit your needs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also includes comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial launch of the program , without any clu@@ e like it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an unusually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; K@@ audio@@ creator ; intended . whoever wants to add or change something useful , may do it . at least after cont@@ acting the author . and if you read this , he left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion .
strange , if you managed to fetch the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time display of lyrics , also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
session support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ graph and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar , like a print on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the piece , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , start &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text events , others use song events and other both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the E@@ rei@@ gni@@ sty@@ p is automatically determined which uses a song , so you don &apos;t have to set anything manually . so , if you select the entry automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the Kar@@ aoke text will be automatically selected .
if you want to set an E@@ rei@@ gni@@ style p , select the entries text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you compose . these are played in sequence . in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click here in New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set each item in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not stored . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . it again appears to the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally adding to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the pop @-@ up sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump vice versa a song back , select the button Pre@@ view piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates General @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et , making a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section which may appear as often as desired . however , it is necessary that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; another key map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that default is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compliant .
this section describes how General MIDI Pat@@ ches can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all the tones that this instrument needs to lay on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun@@ shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun@@ shot .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun@@ shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that this refers to the drum patch of the patch , where each tone represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . see for example the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map out some channels to others . for example , if you want to switch the first and second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel which is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key map with the name will be used for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that will change the patch on this channel will be ignored . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der R@@ atio will indicate in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed only . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM announces that a keyboard which receives a pitch @-@ benefit event is supposed to play a tone higher with the value 40@@ 96 . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try it around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the Di@@ alogue MIDI Settings . you will find this in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played right now .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . in the View menu , select the View menu view : settings
the Tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support it has been compiled . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files separately .
agree that supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , activate automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; - Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . Only you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , I encourage you to program on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much time for my hob@@ bies but I try to collect MIDI files , make music and prove phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lers @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
they make me really happy when you send me a postcard from your place or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will list under Friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but you should contact me as I might already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and doesn &apos;t get any money from anyone . I would like to stress that I only continue programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the main view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the menu book@@ mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and persistent play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / directory can also be changed from the View menu and next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the same playlist from the menu list and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist .
as a result of the ease of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 @-@ option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .

the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically stop by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; Body ; &amp; lt ; l@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ g dur = &quot; file : / / / home / k@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; / Body ; &amp; lt ; / Body ; &amp; lt ; / Body ; &amp; lt ; / Body ; &amp; lt ; / Body ; &amp; lt ; / Body ; &amp; lt ; / Body ; &amp; lt ; / Body ; &amp; lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size of the dat@@ est@@ ro@@ ms from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , like setting up the back@@ end using mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash disk is played with the sw@@ f co@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even insert the special em@@ bed field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file As@@ sign@@ ments of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; S@@ ME ; is to run in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . the stri@@ pping process is called cra@@ pp@@ layer . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
in order for a given back end to be taken for a particular mim@@ e type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; S@@ ME ; can play cards from TV , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog is to be used in the Settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be found ports from which one is selected . the code to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , different names are used by KM@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ sp@@ ection , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ atives , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ ed@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any clu@@ es how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is to be executed as a user root after the device is inserted . it is essential to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be checked for their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically takes the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project includes some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box should be made .
if you have any questions or if you want to compile , or if you want extensions , please contact the Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the opportunity to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling , re @-@ processing and troubleshooting within the source text as well as conversion and viewing tools for this . finally , the easy to use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; plac@@ ard ; and its options should be consul@@ ted the manual to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ ou@@ che : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , also a lay@@ man ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while there is only one good over@@ sight to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book on this . to be able to control &amp; lat@@ ex , good books e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ ation@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick @-@ entry Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some options for creating the document .
document classes : this is the kind of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ type@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ type@@ cl &#93; , &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : the character encoding of the system is set . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a short description of the functions and further information about it will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you want to see green areas of a green text on the screen , it is most likely that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file .
with automatic completion of the environments , typing a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for typing the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows to divide the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub @-@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files the recovery search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; file @-@ dependent file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ano@@ File ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the standard output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices .
when using the retri@@ eval search , the elements of the DVI ; file are bound with the editor and once cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file is the exact opposite of it . as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , it will jump to the appropriate position in the DVI .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings when using a project .
quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI file , in the case of the s@@ ling@@ â s , is used , and there is no call from &amp; oc@@ ul@@ arity ; after quick construction .
when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be noticed . the selection boxes were developed for spe@@ edy inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for spe@@ edy inclusion of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection box for more is to add items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection via a selection field possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ eu@@ e is used for defining font sizes . font sizes can be specified for the main text , foot@@ notes , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and maintaining the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ ate contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font sizes . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
as soon as the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is using the Men@@ Ã ¼ s building or the button of the button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; it will automatically execute the storage .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if it is not the case , the logging should also be followed automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with font sizes e 12 is created , and only a few words should have a different font .
the changes are carried out only within the environment ( from \ \ begin } environment } to \ \ end ( environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold prints , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c pressure and is until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ ratio : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; label language is presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wiz@@ ard , there should be a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , a quote , a few places in bold and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem should be applied to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor &apos;s view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be converted back to the editor ( with internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are needed for creating the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is properly set ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion to other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this , you only need to set up Modern under Settings box ... Tools can be selected .
in order to execute the pre@@ text search , the cur@@ sor has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on pre @-@ selection search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then placed .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . for this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ line ; as text editor .
should a failure occur when using the &amp; DVI file , an error may occur . if there is an error , this will be summ@@ ar@@ ised in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file records the source code in the source code . in the editor , the buttons can be used for errors La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã Â La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . the logging file always speci@@ fies the line in which the error appears . in order to look at the faulty row , the error must be cli@@ cked in the log and &amp; box ; jumps to the defective line .
once you click on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting the empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wiz@@ ard can be used for creating a new document . more information about this can be found in the section .
u@@ fi@@ ge users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be opened or a new file must be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and select file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings box ... settings can be set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by typing in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ ate class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex files . if a simple way to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and follow the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; ards ; and its options should be tigh@@ tened the manual to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command reference that can be called via the Men@@ Ã © La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with the tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way you select \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par \ \ \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
if the arrow keys are used , parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; it has the possibility to search and highlight various kinds of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many wiz@@ ards can capture additional ho@@ ck marks . this is an independent type of book@@ mark inside the text . the menu items Edit Spr@@ ite marks or the respective button of the button have the possibility to jump to the next or last jump @-@ mark . this also applies to this jump stamp , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a draw .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; ards ; already excellent options added , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; always en@@ forces many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only explo@@ itative thing in &amp; Ki@@ le is that the ab@@ sc@@ esses are separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an extended meaning , as this command will also select &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a back layer ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; offers the C@@ tr@@ l ; K key with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for a faster option .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit select he@@ el .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further orders under editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will skip to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the above @-@ mentioned environment can quickly be lost . this command completes the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from editing environment .
this command is used to jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ving clamp .
this command will skip to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ sor .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ v@@ ature of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many ne@@ sted welded group brackets you can quickly lose the above view . this command completes the most recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple instructions are used as a guest . for the appropriate implementation , the character is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the character is used for two simple application characters . also for ending the implementation the character is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two complete guide signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic insert of the double connection characters can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
there can also be customized settings ( e.g. wet or French ) and therefore German or French license plates . there are also many other languages available .
if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a spread@@ sheet environment , t &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a subsequent line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added to boxes ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to achieve this . while pressing Shift , Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the underlying line .
although a good source code is already available , it was added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , five different modes are installed . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set .
when starting a new environment by command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end } environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the return button is pressed , the last letter of the input will be removed and the complete list is enlarged . on the other hand , the list can also be sc@@ aled down by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed from &amp; Ki@@ le , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible , and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Compl@@ et@@ ely you can make settings to these lists . you can select different lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as voice lists of the general language use .
the command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters to be entered with \ \ begin and the call to completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing environments .
when calling the Compl@@ et@@ ely Mode over the menu area , or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically checked and it will appear \ \ begin { . after that , the surrounding area can be continued in the simplest way and be terminated by using the input key .
once this has been completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; Ki@@ le recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be included .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of full extension mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions can be set up . as an example of a cooling list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , is included in the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode is introduced , the character L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large size records are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many we@@ eds are written more than once in a document .
this mode can be set up in the box Settings box ... Ki@@ le vertical down . here , the threshold for the display of the completion can also be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the mobile home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the dialogue graphics design the settings of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphic formats , the sections should be considered and observed .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is enabled , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to view the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ wise in the creation comp@@ iling , converting and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further transformation can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file in the default size viewer can be viewed using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Schnell@@ start command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no one @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... In this@@ you will find the following information for the project :
when running the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the implementation of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a rather sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ til ; are shipped with many documents , included are a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a complete Ref@@ ern@@ ary for &amp; tex ; and its &quot; Fri@@ end &quot; ( Fri@@ end &quot; ) . it is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; this is ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all documents and documents , and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or banners . von &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar open the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ph@@ er and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , which allows &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be executed with OS @-@ X installed .
many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools we all can use in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; license .

version 3.2 by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use com@@ man@@ os as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as substrate . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s lift it a bit , we give it a graphic interface ! no more need to rely on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and you &apos;re done !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the v@@ aul@@ ted working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my pro@@ c is started .
as already mentioned , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book then simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply hoo@@ ked . if not , delete the file with the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the file well @-@ form@@ ed is , click the Well @-@ Form@@ ed review selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema and for the Relax@@ NG review is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , be selected , then simply select the current file . if not , remove the file from the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ des , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can use the additional functionality immediately and don &apos;t have to wait for someone to use the t@@ apped in &amp; GUI ; more about it you will find below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start editing with the menu plug @-@ in . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all of the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project involves several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) will appear fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders if something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later on , how much someone was working on it or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that takes a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project settings dialog can create , edit and delete events .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from ordinary comments by following things :
to enter notes is simple . you can either select the note entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the set nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project Manager Fol@@ lowing the area and sub @-@ project leaders , the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names should be given as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are in@@ sensitive to upper or lower case , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings dialog . this dialog covers some pages that are dealt with one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with regard to tags including car completion can thus be changed . the entries are :
big / L@@ ump@@ y tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically added tags . normal case @-@ writing means that the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ ua files .
big / L@@ ump@@ y attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes automatically added . normal case @-@ sensitive means that the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ ua files .
optional tags include : when checked , it is added to tags for which the closing tag is optional , which is immediately added to &amp; gt ;
exclude optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
update start and end tag automatically : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accent@@ ed characters into appropriate coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default setting can be restored using the Standard Res@@ et button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting is selected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regularly creates backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next startup of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
previ@@ ew@@ ing and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
set the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / depend of views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message area serves the control of the possibility of switching the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the location to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode .
here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser k@@ not in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Settings section , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty knots are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ law abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plu@@ gins are part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by each part @-@ capable application , the best known and kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located in a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load the component in the &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , then select it if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ designed . support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been set , just like the support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger .
currently only one plugin is available that provides support for the use of inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
using the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the button options next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed with time numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower frame .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is produced , or it shares the plugin with to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . happens before a de@@ bug requirement has started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next command in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next command in the script , where possible in functions and include will be corrected .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current one .
open a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can input a variable or set a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can help you get better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for market up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility turns out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag files contain two file types , the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic guiding of image buttons ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow for quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a writing error .
tag folder are nothing but folder . they only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but a single element of itself .
the type of the tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only be used once for each attribute . additionally , it contains the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code for the attributes in tag editor dialog and attribute @-@ tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container day group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog box . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements ending a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be ne@@ atly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause leg breaks , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is only done when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following an example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optionally &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for editing DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = move 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action has been assigned to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut icon can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current short@@ cut is removable .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables which can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance will be added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can take input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus on the default input . in the input field input , you can determine what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected Text : the selected part of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , sent to the standard output , by setting the value of the selected text output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you plan to use them , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available so that it is possible to input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic Show other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size to others .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered to be los , star@@ red , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled that clicking on this icon will insert a &amp; lt ; start the tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be associated with the action . this is done via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be assigned to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar setting dialog via Settings tool bars . make sure the required tool@@ bar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back to the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be installed im@@ pedi@@ folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please fit your descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) is loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most mentioned extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. , ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html , tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html day 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example , which documentation was used for the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the fail resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places , there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , send the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree .
resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , users can download it . contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . to make a good contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key .
when you upload , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New Resource , the input fields have to be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and Script tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag@@ ua format could be needed . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Description : the string that is supposed to appear in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine tuning the D@@ TE@@ P after transformation : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after transformation the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand them and to get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . from tool@@ bars of actions everything that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specially designed for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , allowing the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bar . please check in and for further information on these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing the current , other or all of the cards , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
rect@@ angle in the Editor area leads to a further context menu on the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , help the word under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor or open the file , if the string under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is a file .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now , you can insert the data for this particular tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog box different fields .
the construction prospects ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate to open and ro@@ am them . in the presentation with anti@@ trust boards are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building views .
project management is a powerful tool providing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows administrators to manage files in the project using a right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on where they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; global templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the application system aligned with the content makes it possible to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two leaders at the bottom of the window can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the check @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , like any other store and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while striving to create the best &amp; HTML @-@ editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why development , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details in the details are using help : / Qu@@ anta ( either enter this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or run k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the template section . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported .
converted when inser@@ ting from cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to &amp; html ; en@@ rolling , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ S@@ elling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages exist !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
training and switching on the problem re@@ porter at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter will be activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Forecast or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu , group@@ ed by the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; off and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions need to be stored by means of settings . tool@@ bars are stored by tool@@ bars tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you are asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it doesn &apos;t delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as appen@@ di@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities of the &amp; DT@@ D ; It makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be re@@ plen@@ ished without renew@@ ing the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the load will fail .
this menu provides a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( html ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current Tag Settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inclusion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar refuses to comply with the rules this day .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the type ; -@@ version .
very useful when you know people who are using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ int@@ osh .
check the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or cause un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
switches the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , main window .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
speci@@ fies the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; posters , you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which you can add and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , because , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift , F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering your name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
get hoo@@ ked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hook .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profile or modified with the Shift key ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
complementary option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set using the button Options .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing a particular tree view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn event actions and add , modify , or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a certain event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at this time .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the project file is automatically stored . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will occur . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage the files in the current project .
folders do the same , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only more one profile exists , the button is blan@@ ked to prevent removal .
the password will be stored in the core memory and forgotten in the end of the program . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure storage of the disk option is not possible .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created and uploaded to different servers for the project ( or parts of the project ) . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this doesn &apos;t have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give a lot of views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted by the Project Tool@@ bar menu or the project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own working method .
as mentioned above are tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , best stack@@ able via the tool bar . usage and addition are different . adding tool@@ bars is treated at the bottom of the tool bar section .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set using the context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars can be ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , where it can be indicated which actions on these or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will also be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bars ... and set Settings actions .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , basically uses templates like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing to the system in the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you set for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be binary files except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and arran@@ ges the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates . see for more information on the Tem@@ plate tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basis .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire web sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save as a local template ....
as soon as this happens , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , you can simply drag and drop the selection to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project file tree view , select a name for the template and secure a name for the template , but of course it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates provide a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically link to &amp; PHP ; create , insert , or associate files with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in sub@@ windows templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder in the template overview and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types described before ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded when par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder was set in such a way , it would disable templates in this path , unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ building block . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ dict@@ ated or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be generic head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , allowing for copying of content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers a whole presentation already with matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you can use context menu ( to show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back to source code editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the un@@ doing of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor are displayed synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 will activate this mode , if the button is activated , the active cur@@ sor is moved from one window to another , and the position in the document is retained .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can select between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small span for fast computers and a large ap@@ ot for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose document properties . thus , editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created .
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click into the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cur@@ sor is used as usual . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves especi@@ al . the marking function as usual . text can be inserted through typing and deleted by push@@ button or removal button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way as the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor day .
some tool bars such as the She@@ ets Assistant or the Listen Wiz@@ ard are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for analyzing style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , search for certain elements is possible and the execution of style sheets can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , need except &amp; k@@ de ; libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame with no path description . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with rel@@ ativ@@ ly path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g working folder , for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire match with a pre@@ position named my@@ ME or a specified mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP scale that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace specified in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 gets &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically done when loading the first template using x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another progra@@ mmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; while automatically selecting the correct changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge full folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and deals with the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check co@@ ders , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
when a file is the same and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , you can make typing easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o Dest@@ ination folder
opening dialog allows manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will notice your selection and show it next time . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
via the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders is initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C however a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field is active and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to immediately set an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the Set@@ ting button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge process .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you don &apos;t have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the break button .
you can also drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar features . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare it . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
if differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription Edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; when you edit the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows the group belonging to the line is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group is otherwise not visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more row left in the group by automatic merging or manually editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source . this text will not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker you might copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this feature .
note : when selecting the sources the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side on , side off , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the default window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and sp@@ elling mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ bottom / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Up / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , differences between sol@@ utes and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the mark to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l paste ) . if enabled , whatever you mark will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted . be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ .
the options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved when loading and restored at the next startup . ( menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen script doesn &apos;t support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems , the button Pre@@ ferences automatically sets an odd color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
when you press En@@ ter or Return , the input of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copying to the cli@@ p@@ board is then om@@ itted .
you can choose which line @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored . even when merging , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others in turn save a line feed character , but then files with different sizes may appear identical in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , though they are different . when this option is enabled , this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow in very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . see for details see Docum@@ entation to compare and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
above the selection fields for coding , a short note appears , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has purely informal character for you . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding to save .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the output of pre @-@ processing instructions .
turn this off to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in the text or view columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignored C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . up @-@ to @-@ date file merge in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click will start the merge and use the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first committed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your requirements .
when a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . the output of the command is only used with the line balance . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program that by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into upper case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a gra@@ ceful expression of the found text in the first log pair . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so basically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and merging . further operations only change the data that the line balance algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes the text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... simul@@ ating and simul@@ ating the simulated changes without actually carrying them out ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you just need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged then folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not merging . to start merging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window of the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared to that point are listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by opening the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions to fold all sub @-@ directories and fold all sub @-@ directories with which you can open or fold all folders .
when double @-@ clicking on a file , the comparison window will be started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the Details Pan@@ e to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as can be seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then , folders will also have the same color . in folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started .
syn@@ cing mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified , and if the option directories sync is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merging and storing the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B by A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New file is selected instead of merge ( unsure ) , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different but the same date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
while merging , one file is executed after the other . you status column displays Fer@@ tig if the merge was successful , and corresponding other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then the three @-@ folder merge @-@ mode C is used as the target , for two @-@ folder merging , B is selected as the target and for synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by the specified entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select folder merging / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to just merge the current entry , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid merge actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options through , simul@@ ating and ab@@ ort .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen shot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select Start / Continu@@ e directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , an appropriate dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to determine the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you will have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue merging .
if some entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them once again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; Def@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than one pattern entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than one pattern entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceding point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
if the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in default .
for links to folders : if the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders are treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not include any potential recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a continuous loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is turned off in default .
the complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security .
similar to the Date of Change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equally large . for example , this can be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
enables syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging the copy of the newer file as action is suggested ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed too . ) This option is turned off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not just the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder merging view is visible while merging single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the window divi@@ der to the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory &amp; text window .
probably you prefer to simply compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder merge .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ F@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path may be relative and@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the date of change devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is at present as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ de@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In Cat Part Display from the context menu .
normally it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program will recover to recover the missing file .
in the kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part executed , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it is compact ) already exists . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path or want to go this way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably not announce the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure installed configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be treated as identical . if similar lines appear to each other , this will be the case .
the editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information .
the effort required for this has so far been too large . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text you should use another editor .
after removing text is sudden ; No sr@@ c is sweeping ; no sr@@ c has been released and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and lots of people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
for information on how to use K@@ F@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de@@ 3 , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should you still encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists thereof .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and cle@@ ars the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders don &apos;t appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current version of the program you will need to re @-@ read the Update button after changes to these options . )
if the destination folder does not already contain these files , it will be missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later version of the program . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the Lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed again when clicking the button .
in default , this option is disabled . various characters in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both within a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the motion is possible both within a desktop as well as on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries to set up p@@ ager ... and termin@@ ate . if you cli@@ cked on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the symbol and name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maxim@@ ise , on desktop and termin@@ ating .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ tops .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is inter@@ sec@@ ted together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty working areas are displayed to enable them to be selected .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the order of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ Main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid , as from p@@ ager applications appear in some other windows managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work@@ tops are horizontal and vertical in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager @-@ mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying and moving windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch settings ... allow the dialog to appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog box . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you have no write permission for the file , you must login as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign a value . possible values are :

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; K@@ mag , a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impairment .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window appears as magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as a selection window below .
in the default setting , enlarged &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can display &amp; K@@ mag ; for this purpose , you can view a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ drop mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter setting . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the zoom window . this also works with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
stopping or stopping the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , High@@ ly ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short instructions for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and cr@@ ushing &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; for this purpose you can use a magni@@ fying glass to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates one mouse click as soon as the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter persi@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by a doctor if this has not yet happened .
in order to clarify it once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by mouse @-@ clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you break the movement shortly .
if the smart move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates the pressing of the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this dwell time must be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool exec@@ utes a mouse click .
if Intel@@ lig@@ ently shifting is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing down the mouse button wait before it lets you release the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse happens in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . these movements will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ ll@@ .@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slide control sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
this setting is selected , will be started &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program automatically .
set all settings on the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings are reset to the state after the user &apos;s last ind@@ entation .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with default settings . in particular , the smart move should be turned off first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart moving .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease in sounds .
first you should be aware of which places a mouse click is left without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse jer@@ ks , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick here is that you don &apos;t just clean the ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse varies . however , it should be clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the wheels . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or a finger@@ nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when a move is started . if you use the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer stop by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you do a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and use the cur@@ sor to another position .
solution : use the mouse to move the cur@@ sor to where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title rows of windows .
I try to work with the smart moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is probably possible to select text to copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board , or to execute any other action when you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click on one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the smart moving even without the audi@@ ble mouse click .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension must be installed for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse cur@@ sor quickly as soon as the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor res@@ umes . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and which causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait for a specific time to start a pulling process before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can be performed using the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that dum@@ b users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken once again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for text output of text . for more details , please refer to the Setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages without typing them .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to make only correctly sp@@ elled words into the word supplement .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a flow storage of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each set is attached to the default memory . you can select Sets that should be spoken once again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the word completion page and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the voice output menu , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , set the character encoding , which will be passed on to the speech generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator unchanged .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator . examples for this are found in the appen@@ di@@ x .
with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ em@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passages book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant , the selected passage of the text will be spoken directly and inserted in addition to the default memory . the selected text passage is only entered into the input field with the selection of In the input field .
with the second drop of the editing window of the editing window , you can determine whether the text pass@@ book script should be automatically saved when the editing window is closed .
save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book script will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be saved .
the word supplement page contains a list of words for the word completion . in the main window beside the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them into a file . below the list , you can select the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the selection box .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Docum@@ entation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; adding newly entered words into the dictionary automatically creates a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of the text or the respective short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via selection in the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .

if this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding guide is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar to another position .
probably you haven &apos;t entered the command for voice output correctly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the voice output menu . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
festival is a language edition system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ e.@@ The voice output is then possible with one of the following command samples :
for the third example , the option must be enabled to send data as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German lyrics to MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ em@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the language generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to set the settings , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who can &apos;t speak , display text by computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re@@ write .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer needs to be installed on your computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found at help : / k@@ mouth ( type this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programm@@ ers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS skills .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; even if &amp; ards ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
speech output is provided via the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ enabled . you can also find the developer in the IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , Channel # k@@ de ) .
before you can use it , you need to install the speech @-@ schedul@@ er and adjust it correctly .
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card is shown in general .
most T@@ TS Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher will otherwise use the default speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer sp@@ ears for the same printer .
if you click on the card leader speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet a speaker is set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ u ; system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the speaker card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the card card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text orders and manage text . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the tab General to open this card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the K@@ DE T@@ TS service . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it is running &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled to activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar while reading , it disappears once the reading has been completed .
with buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause , and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be adopted on all sides .
the orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that is to be read and select Tools text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text displayed . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that is to be read and select Tools text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works if &amp; gt ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fies you about events that you have set . you can read the text of these messages even from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to the application .
filter for string replacement offer a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ts ; to correct incorrect or faulty messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of supply of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by email , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ osed .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
filters are processed in filters before they are sent to the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation , to replace wrong spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working method of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of text .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the screen reader edition is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the issuing of the warning .
breaking news interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can come with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you use from the flash@@ card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads them , this output is stopped and stopped .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ actors . they are applied to normal aler@@ ts , messages and text orders as well as &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters available .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the sub@@ stit@@ uting parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; supplied with pre @-@ defined label inser@@ tion filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting messages ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ forms use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ml .
with subscri@@ ber @-@ selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice on the flash@@ card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read more about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text to the next filter .
if a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters created on the page below . the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of established standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are executed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the further below installation di@@ alogs are displayed .
you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern for the set @-@ up of string replacement filters . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it just has to be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is executed in the order displayed from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here . click on the button to display a list of languages .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you get the application ID running programs with q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID number @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only type copied .
the string replacement filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; print &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package .
XML ; Trans@@ forms translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such implement@@ ations .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
you can send text to a certain speaker , set up on the speaker card , or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker characteristics that the program provides , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts , and the features of the speakers furnished on the card card . you can over@@ ride the selected speaker with the spokesperson sel@@ ector filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is on your system the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can access it with one click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , that is , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text matches the filter conditions above , the speaker will be selected to display the required requirements . click the button on the right to display the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your spokes@@ man settings or delete all settings .
the voice selection filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the speech output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ hau@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , enter
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ window . first run kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival websites don &apos;t read web pages .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you also need to do this even if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gib@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the option set encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be corrected by a string replacement filter .

the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you will find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that own a own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ mmel with &amp; kt@@ ts ; download it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; find the source code of k@@ de@@ mmel at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with every speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information not yet included in this manual .
the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to extend it to another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , from the source code archive for tag points or downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if speech @-@ schedul@@ er is working correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it uses the program speech @-@ schedul@@ er . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so further that the setup of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into single sentences . the user can leave set or paragraph styles , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
for example , if you have a speaker , whose language is English and whose sex is female , it will be used , otherwise it will automatically select the best speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in .
if you click Add to Add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the box speaker setup will be displayed . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . for details on the modules you will find under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you just have to enter festival .
select the text encoding for text that is passed to the Festival . in the case of voices which are known &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 apply , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few regul@@ ators and display this gray , the voice chosen by you does not allow these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click to App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the option to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker .
with the buttons in this row , you can move forward or back in the order listed in the list below . ( but not each assignment consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr becomes a symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
only text orders are listed and managed . editions of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts , please refer to .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compil@@ es or &amp; kt@@ ts without support for the corresponding audio module ; can &apos;t load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equ@@ als about half and 200@@ мм ; % about the double normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you have to figure out which device works with you . in case of doubt choose Standard .
on this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech applications :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the screen reader has been read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can come with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nonetheless someone who just walks the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or the output of a screen reader , it adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output enters the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played prior to the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special promotions for messages , warnings and the editions of Screen Re@@ aders if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click aler@@ ts .
select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read aler@@ ts .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications for which a sound is played are from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent if someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ml is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default one , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ml .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit@@ er filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single sentences . this can be faster with reading , since only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly .
here you can see the set limit@@ er filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit@@ er filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add more set limits filtering filters , but beginners will be advised .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the language selection is to try out the language selection . turn off the language selection , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s choice is changed . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster to start reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then hold or break orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the standard set of rules is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut down , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit@@ er filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit@@ er filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ V ) , warnings , messages , or the output of screen re@@ actors .
if you have removed the normal set limit@@ er filter from default , you can re @-@ paste it by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the Vo@@ cabulary Book of Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection , you can over@@ ride the language settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card speaker ) . in other words : no speakers are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , who is most likely to have the originally set properties .
select the method to input the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker here . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
select this check box if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a primary feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only way you might want to specify the attribute language is present if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one placed in the working environment .
to use all the features in the area Spo@@ kes@@ person , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default driver button and then use speaker that is most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .

the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ reading .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if your speech synthes@@ izer is working correctly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you must install at least one language . help find this in the instructions provided with the Festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice sets Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / click / r@@ ussi@@ an . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , seek festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , encoding must be set to an 8 bit cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , synthes@@ izer . then , festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival creates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate di@@ phone from German texts .
in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the Fol@@ der Festival / li@@ b / .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user to perform the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded when the option Network Set@@ ting at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be identified , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose from the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and best . by selecting the setting of non @-@ recurring questions , the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed grey , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire module &apos;s functionality is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... in the dialog Device setup .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options .
in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration can be done . in the IP address field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching off a switched @-@ off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching off an activated network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking on interface .
defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is by default used for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a machine with DNS support replaces a full domain description by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requires ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the Rei@@ ter name resolution makes it easy to manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .@@ DNS entries can be added to priority by selecting an entry and / or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the kno@@ bs Hin@@ der or Her@@ under .
by clicking on the Add ... from the group computer to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
from the group computer to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display dialog Edit .
the Nam@@ ed Calcul@@ ator list describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list Nam@@ eal @-@ known calcul@@ ator contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP is to replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be shown .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , press the button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog friend computer is displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the home page of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console , with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical user interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally , the development packages are required with libraries and others .
this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second one will be discussed all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files .
this section cannot replace advanced knowledge about IP networks . in this appen@@ di@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is conveyed .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be used in the near future . therefore , this description is currently concentrated on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is al@@ lied . in other networks , on &amp; eg ; the network administrator is the contact point that provides a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily .
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose , to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , usually addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed loop .
this part contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL links , so it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections no other content will be found there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is handled by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another level than expected can therefore occur .

to insert an environment variable , first one must be cut or copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . only then is the option insert at all available . then select the variable folder . then go to Edit Settings .
to change a variable , first select the variable to edit .... Altern@@ atively , you can use the right mouse button to click the variable and change ... or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It will then appear in the dialog box in which you can edit the variable as described above .
to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete .
to activate or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it , and specify the state with the Edit Activ@@ ated menu item . when a de@@ activated variable is de@@ activated , description De@@ activated .
alternatively , you can use the right mouse button to click on the variable and select Activ@@ ated . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab .
alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will only become active .
it appears the standard node ; -@@ Print dialog . if you choose out fl@@ aps , you will see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have extended per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the time schedules of the users .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing .
before a tape can be used it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; tro@@ t the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detect &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the pre@@ sp@@ ann on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ ann , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been incorporated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed through au@@ let@@ tes of the entry for the band .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; speci@@ fies a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . if your tape drives prec@@ e@@ des that a tape has to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; flo@@ ppy tape drives normally require format@@ ting the tape , however , DA@@ T drives do not .
after input of the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the band . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you set up the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Sich@@ ern menu ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens Settings for Backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files once again and change the settings for backup .
once you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the volume with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry Veri@@ fy ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
ri@@ ght@@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for restoration .
once you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index on the basis of the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of tape :
this will create a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are stored , which are located on the same file system as the folder . folders located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
exec@@ uting an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
if this setting is active , sends &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is inserted , the command will load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection from the tape drive . it may not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , the band automatically dis@@ cards when releasing the &amp; k@@ dat ; do not use this option at flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware @-@ file block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The tape ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band id is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are tar archives , which can be managed directly with the GNU ; tar files . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not for incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system holds the different protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , tries to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup , try &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , open the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or set strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color as minutes lines of level indication . the color representation of protocol rows can be turned off setting dialog .
if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can use the option To jump to new lines in the main window context menu , to display all the new protocol rows added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of several protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the Window Pan@@ e to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. d@@ ort you will find more current information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming standard for the control of the program boot when the system runs up in the &amp; Linux world . and that is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to system V in@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel first looks under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another run@@ time . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; system services , on the other hand , do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t have much use . you can also make a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , which has to do with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for the program in@@ it at different places and starts the first one that it finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line as the following in the beginning area :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default running level is 3 . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you make changes to the in@@ it@@ tab .
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if a K contains , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user @-@ run level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six Run@@ level to launch it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ &apos; or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens when you pull out an entry from the area of the available system services .
note : entries are moved when you move them to a new level . in order to only copy them to a new level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area , even if the same entry previously existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different work areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the typing button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu will require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ ing , and now the machine is constantly re@@ started . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in stand@@ alone mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE , or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary alignment programs of these distri@@ butions but is unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) just end without message if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to start reading .
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the respective icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry stored in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some card cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space limitations ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings .
the card card password management appears , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears , if for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ net file on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space limitations are in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with space limitation with the help of the field fil@@ esystem .
the Groups tab informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , you will find in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . the editing or del@@ e@@ tion of the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boat manager , add , remove and change the boot password , add time to boot of the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
