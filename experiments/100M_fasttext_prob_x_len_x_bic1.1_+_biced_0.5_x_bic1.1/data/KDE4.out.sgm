<seg id="1">To translate the module website you will find in & konqueror; -menu under Extras webpage. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the location of the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations cannot make important decisions without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert translations directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & conqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror, by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings Setting Settings... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the package kde; addons. please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package kdebase that contains & konqueror before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the & konqueror; click on extras crashes. then you can view the page that has & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module View filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar with Tools View filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentelement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative to the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView is to display nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">In & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily recognized when it is far down in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have useful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over to color mode, can display either depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property, such as the name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can determine whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or if the area is to be used by sub-ordinate rectangles.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of representation algorithms for treemaps, the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the item. at the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always maintained.</seg>
<seg id="20">How partition the area of an entry takes place for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames, that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimally represented area for an entry via the menu entry View Analog at area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally it was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction into the use of the TreeMap widget designed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the picture gallery module, a dialog opens with which you can specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery in a text box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotational field to set the number of thumbnails in each row in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">Display the file name of the image with the check box file name of the image to see if the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the check box file size of the image, you determine whether the file size is displayed among the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the check box image size, you determine whether the size of the images is displayed below the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder, specify where the gallery will be saved and which subfolders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save in HTML file, specify where to save the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set a slider or a script to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original pictures with the check box, whether the original images should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment file check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnail images than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML-settings can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find the media playback for the navigation area in the & konqueror; -menu under window navigation pane or with the key symbol F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror, where you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that refuse access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser recognition to call the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Use elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set-in browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">By setting up the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information on the browser and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; -documents in accordance with W3C and other standards.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and instantly download your photos. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by gphoto2. of course, each media and card reader that is supported by your OS will work with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicode; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, rate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image plug-ins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitised; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or the lens that can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digikam, an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">If you are in the program, the Help menu contains one entry issues or wishes to report.... This will open a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the bug report system. all necessary information is entered here. follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam site, visit the homepage to find news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved and digitised; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to log in in the developer mailing list of & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & edit; for the first time you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data collection is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want to add. & digikam, you will also use as an old library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as base folder. & digikam; see every subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam, thirsting recursively the library path across its depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless you paste it in hidden folders. you can do this by setting a dot in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenklist do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Resource support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can & digiplug; possibly also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu help RohkameraSupport.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set this up and work with raw files is described in the Rh-Decoder Preferences and Rh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and instantly download your photos. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by gphoto2. of course, each media and card reader that is supported by your OS will work with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera is often used as a disk drive unit. the camera can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232) under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras, which has an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the preview images of digiKam. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might see thumbnail images or the creation might be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to digiplug is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-in Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KIP album, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to make the modules available to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitised; by writing a small module to complement one function, as the changes in & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the Albenbaums, above the horizontal divider line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the filename only works if this is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed, you can configure in the dialog box settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they are stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date when the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose the album Imported images to scan. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the picture with the mouse to the target album and drop it down. in the then appearing menu, you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you must right-click on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos when you choose to add or delete collection from the toolbar collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">Album Date: used if you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The oldest, average, New Year buttons: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. this first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file in this folder will be used instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digikam, open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenistequot; this is to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; Add as album preview quot; In addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left bottom of the main window. album collections always include all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo will be shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a short while, while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this in which you can recreate all preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be shown below the previewed thumbnail. what information this is can be edited by editing Settings; set up the albums site and adjust the preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help buttons, which appear. if you leave the mouse-cursor a moment over an image. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the introductory section of the main window displays such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about & digiplug; go. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image Editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can access all the functions that are with & digiplug; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by calling either F4 Picture Editing... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... you can find a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digicam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by checking the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub-menu of opening. for this, and how you customize it to your needs, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image. this information is lost from EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest is to right-click the preview and select rotation. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can right-click the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved to the garbage dump of & kde; F8 Picture Delete or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Delete.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Datummistrequot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos that have been selected with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also fold sections of the tree & quot; My stub & quot; My stuffed monkey collection, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and allocated keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword quot; or on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this will become the subset of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and put it there. then a menu will appear that gives you the opportunity to postpone the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and set it in the context menu as the album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can happen in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; drag and drop there. alternatively, you can also click on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the words assigned to it. in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event at which it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keyword, this will appear in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and remove from the pop-up menu Remove from the menu. the menu only shows the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline display shows a time-dependable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved by this histogram. to select a time frame you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the box, which indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the box below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">The search box is a small lamp that becomes green when finding matches. if you click here, the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the light will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search is done. the results are used in the View My search list in the main window. the text field Save Search is used to make your request a name in My search list. if you want to change your selection after the search, you just need to select the appropriate entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you choose to edit searches, the search form will appear with the search information entered before. if you choose to edit as advanced search, the search will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Clear in the context menu search.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digiplug; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted from it. each option can be associated with others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; each image is characterized by a long number using a special technique, the hair algorithm. this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures. the lower the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar. if you move an image from anywhere on the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it down there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketches: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the right images. also here, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This rider provides an intuitive map finder based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or move it and move it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your pictures contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the box below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this is then added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicam; provides a luminous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image data formats, also raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L The light table add from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window and place there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select Preview syncing from the toolbar and perform zoo and move operations on one of the images, then you can compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly order from a series of pictures. if you navigate pair-wise navigate from the toolbar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to the same. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it in the right-hand area. this simplifies it through a series of similar pictures to work through.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area, you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to swivel the visible area of the picture, you must click on it and hold the & LMB; in the preview, both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. simply use the zoom-knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect, and use photos again. we focus on the processes for digital fotographers that & digikam, use. we view the download, rename, remove, convert, group, secure, evaluate, grant, maintain, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital Stock Management assumes, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, converts, assembles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need no longer to find a specific photo without stock management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you will certainly not use & digiplug;. the approach to save the metadata both in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, such as versioning of photos, archiving, work sequences, constant access of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend storing the metadata option in the Settings page of the metadata in & digikam, to activate. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the relevant point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what's going to change? to do this, & digikam, provides them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now assign key words, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's talk with keywords, keyword, as you frequently call other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digiplug; automatically set the tree for you to paste the images in the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam, while it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata is overlapped. this is a very crude representation, since each block of metadata is in truth out of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labeling or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anybody see your photos only, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closely, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachute; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! one starts to dream, have associations, memories, the historical time span is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a caption for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as labeling. you can even export it for a selection of images. if you export your images in web galleries, these captions will be exported to your specifications in the caption and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train of the spatial presentation now starts with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation are countless and will be even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels through images with Google Earth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, i.e. also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setting page of & digikam means to be deposited as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples of this can be titles as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this must be filled in as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendors): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that offers the image to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calculator can delete or change this, embedded in the image. for individuals, this is very important for most of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitised; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: sheet error, disk failure, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterprevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are dealing with problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">Of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can become unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age them by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles among CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-propriety format. you should also read the media with a description, date & author and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer's warranty covers a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives for this topic: disk study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART can not detect these errors. some of SMART's errors announce the imminent failure. this is especially reading errors and transhipment counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power loss before you have saved the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">This can cause serious damage on devices with computer chips and high-speed process processors. these can cause serious damage on your computer, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. so protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in connector. remember, however, that not each connector also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected. some manufacturers provide a surge shock, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically supply battery power when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to save your data and run down the system. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W UPS you can pay for less than & euro; 40.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that lets you store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. furthermore, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suited as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a common backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned up thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies, a backup and a distributed memory are included in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in your computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensures at least the data integrity of the operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all of these malfunctions remain undetected until you have lost a photo to your surprise. it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already 2010, you will see thousands of mistakes a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrf file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; it is not yet a part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. for notebooks, the share of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage than e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most popular file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are located 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural barrier for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteriorated. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk is now responsible for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so, backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like reinstalling your operating system, the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make every day your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash strikes you luck if the drive wasn't connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane crash: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they normally affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore desasterprevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as stated above, a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of the files that have been really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other visual medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored in the image file, IPTC information, associated XMP files, maintaining original memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., using the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in, because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider everything that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time passes. unfortunately, there is no other option than letting go of a certain vigilance.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and you want to increase the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated plate or partition. in * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; resize2fs / dev / sdc # change the size of the drive if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create them yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is a lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that it has relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open portrait format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; Technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive a copy of your photo, mostly in raw format. XMP fits this as it saves the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include the work on the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard compounds and enlightening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edium, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For finer editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images back with & digikam, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off by the other programs under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="247">Use the edited pics for copyright with a digital watermark. then export them to web galleries, encode them in mpeg, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digities. see adding a photo to an album you will find a description on how to add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and switch it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a ferent indicator appears at the bottom end and the preview images of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the lateral bars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata display shows the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer remark, GPS, etc. of the picture. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam, or image processing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam, and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired ones using the standard selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, you can download the download button and download Selected.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have not been edited by & digikam. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the Find All or download selection buttons, a dialog appears that lets you select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of the existing albums is displayed, like normal folders sorted. then select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digikam, load the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you want to delete some, you must select them first and then delete the selected deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded to a & digicode album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera file completely, you should do this via the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are normally recycled after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can result in duplicate filenames, if you upload photos from different recording series to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will automatically be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two relate the data to the author in the Standard Car Identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information in the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want another date format than standard format, e.g. in the edit field, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the option date & time to add. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters, or in uppercase letters if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digicode; used for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitised; can use any information on camera orientation at the time of recording to perform automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is normally turned on, and if your camera doesn't deliver that information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the lower area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date that the photo was made available, & digikam, this use to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the page header Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally turned off, and in this case it stores & digikam, the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option on. use the Advanced button and select the Date-based calming option at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digikam, you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder chooser dialog for the camera will appear. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in length and width grading and which can be displayed on a map. data analysis can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser with a click that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug; users want to send a postcard to a different & digiplug; or simply want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that there are many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitchords, and map references. the question is actually more about how data flows into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a follow-up of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic mapping (manual) and last about manual entry of known sites.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a couple working with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsor or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for Windows and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the preloaded coordinates created by maps.google for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicam; tries to give you as much control over its workflow as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to select Settings. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded thumbnail or image editing. you specify the default behavior of & digikam, fixed when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. even in case of database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC data fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author's line: this field should contain the professional title of the photographer. this can be names such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to specify the one that offers the photo. this does not have to be the author, if this is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here as this is the image other & quot; anbieta quot;. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC acts store the data in the corresponding IPTC felders.This ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the & digikam database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported and edited without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image captions as embedded labeling (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page Settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse-cursor rests on a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the brightness of & digiplug; can be set on this page to the default values. however, if you then open the LED, these settings if enabled. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchrone mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; you should only use on fast computers. if you have one then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image. these colors are set here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subscription it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF file option, you can turn the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect image quality, because the Deflate algorithm works without loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">With setting lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. as this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was only one image viewer for photos. at present, it is rapidly becoming a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are equal. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor react when sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output. this option records the image a little soft but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard, it is a solid color balance that is based on a white card photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the pointed-out, so the parts of your images that are burned-in are to see the pointed-lights in the settings because of the inability of your camera to look at the pointed-lights. the setting colors will generate some unusual results, since they show the pointed-lights in various roatballs.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstruction option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should be individually adjusted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the frame options of the & digiplug; image editing. to keep the time for the demo-icing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color-filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which a matrix of coloured pixels is available. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicam; and Dcraw make three alternatives available: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenated Directed) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw. however, it produces color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction, as it is performed during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be returned. there are also LCMS and & digikam. information such as colour information from one color space to translate into the other is thus the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour Questions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Sets you to the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC in which you save all your profiles. & digikam, examine this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalibre or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like Canon which do not contain any color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you have to carry out the color-mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile with which you can emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors may therefore seem very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension allows you to recognize the style for the goal: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface, & digiplug; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and they will then be loaded by & digikam. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the previews.</seg>

<seg id="324">More information (in English) via KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slider settings should be easy to understand. the upper slider adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds good. the other check boxes turn the metadata inside or out, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties on the left side show a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Automatic recognition that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer, and if you want to use it, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on, and in the image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify here the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, where you can mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, you must connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digiplug; the camera detects automatically. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can choose any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window's menu. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the trash bins, you can see the dialog by & digikam, set in an album when deleting a photo. in the deletion of a photo and deletion of an album, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly supported by & digikam, if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without re-enquiries. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the knob chants.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the welcome screen by & digiplug; while staring, it may speed up & digiplug the startup process.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim Start looking for new photos forces & digikam, to look for the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digikam;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, asks & digikam, you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digikam, used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar settings in settings design. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& edit; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the entry / editing context menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image Editing contains a set of tools to improve your images. some of these are available as modules in & digikam, so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see Setting Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you cannot recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your picture before you change it. you can save it with file Save As.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you haven't saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore button from the File Restore button or the Restore button Restore in the toolbar. you will then loose any change you've done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image editing can be undone or restored. the last action can be reversed by modifying or recreating Editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB on the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are reversed or restored in between.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword, using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, down picture, or using the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen. you come to the normal view where you can use the Esc button. normally, the toolbar is displayed. if you do not want this, you can change it in the editing dialog by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sets. whole picture pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select the printer wizard from the Album Exports menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a sidebar on the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation file, also available in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should observe these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field Urgency. the coding will follow the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword-tree and a selection box with the keywords applied previously in this & digicode session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword-tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword. you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords for a series of pictures. if you have typed different keywords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword-tree, this is applied only to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the Keyword Fill section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar Keyword Filters is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop words. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword has already existed, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the above example the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three pictures. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword-tree has been drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be turned off under settings Different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, key term, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an advanced search across all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options see then as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why didn't Picasaweb and Flickr not be listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted it to & digikam, s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that you have a predictable deviation from the actual or scanned colors from your camera or scanner. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish on the web that matches your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means you make informed choices at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make sure you make informed choices about color management.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are e-mail or web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to callibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor, since sRGB means that your; onitor works on sRGB, then you must either callibrate your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, synchronize, automatic synchronization and contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic Correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which is best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the Leustcoefficient values over the entire image, leaving the darkest point black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed away.</seg>
<seg id="391">Abase: this method adjusts the luminous factor of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes, the comparing is very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces trash. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue canals to the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Extending Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible with well-washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digiplug; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited since using a color space with 8-bit per color. so if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. they run it over the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be customized in size. on the left side, both the original image and preview of the target image can be seen. preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow to click.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up, a histogram is shown that will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images that have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment allows you to improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the Preferences list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of the white balance you set can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save these settings, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the coding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour-mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consulted in the Color Administration chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find tone correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use them for several photos at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for toning correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gradation that you will find in colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug-tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In the period of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when using a partially developed pressure from a short flash light and subsequently inverted the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negatives of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment creates a negative image that cannot be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and this works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliantly and glow. try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the strength of the neon light. in large pictures, the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photos. you can view the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice for reducing saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you perform can be seen in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple rejecting / contrast / Gamma, the tool is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slide for the application described here. concrete the three slides below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slides are clicked in and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the knob and watch how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. previewing is dynamic, with the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lower for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pintes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a knob for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a burnt image as background while something else is visible in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. for this purpose, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input value is readjusted automatically for all shadows, means and sun shades. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the histogram input for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to detect overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side displays half of the original and the target image. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is mostly the most sensible. for pictures with large areas of constant color, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode will continue to help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short piece to the right, e.g. the light tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker pronouncements and that the corresponding image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to shift this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly that. each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">Select the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curves.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the Luminance canal. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the colors of the images. you can edit it from the Color channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram appears to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are below: control for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness even if you also activate the color components. this is especially convenient if you also activate the option Monochrome, as the channel mixer then is THE tool to generate great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of color leads to a visible noise coming from the eyebrow. color-like consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you first reduce the color.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save and load buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved and loaded for later use. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to detect overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, because color pictures can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green Filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lentil filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangefilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lentil filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at daytime. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiano: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the attunes. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and the redevelopment in a Sepideroner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen, stitch an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping an observer's eye on the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your picture. lined with a colored line, Niepce bordered it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), it surrounds it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a knock effect and decorative trim adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specify the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The pattern decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert easily a formatted text into one image at any position. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text orientation, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press OK button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can't be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool template can apply a template over an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image Template applied in image editing can be used to lay templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compressing (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the & digicode; template file digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button Basic Folder in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the template files. these settings are scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for the stencils, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the template bar of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below is a preview of three buttons that can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge This button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button will shrink the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must decrease the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Shift: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicode; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but it generates grainy images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture blurred. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process has to sum up colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this, in turn, results in sharp edges a little blurred. SLR cameras usually need more later sharpening than normal cameras for home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpness. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of focus while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry Conducer Archiving.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you will achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften with the menu entry Correcise Soft drawing and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in radius or amount intensifies the effect. if you make the blurring mask to strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the apply difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter. this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharper and therefore beauty mistakes in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the fuzzy masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture (2). blurred masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected defection filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocusing achieves mostly better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by calling colors to focus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">The Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauss's folding is even very strongly influenced by the removed pixels. it causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values are close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, eg, the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">This is most often caused by a previously executed blurring filter. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge. note however that the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Charging buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any refocusing parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections in the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that much surgery changes that are not immediately visible, but leave unwanted artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, eg, than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp Maskieren produces better results than sharpness. this could be caused by the Unsharp Masking using a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, Unsharp Masking must always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the blurring. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The controller smoothes the blur of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tinting allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the Rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values are mainly smoothed in homogenous regions and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should be preserved in such a way that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the detail conservation should always be subject to directional dependence.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD noise will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-step-amplitude da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the higher quality you get by choosing this option is minimal. it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Corrected image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the abortion button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image flaws with Small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you can see, there is a unique black artifact in the foreground that caused by poor movie relocation during the trip. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced settings can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors corrected.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details, and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy of the filter. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong you can't remove all the noise or noise peaks. set it to a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a faint noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically more smokeable.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother, if it is too high, noise and phase jitter may appear on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected (2). noise reduction has been applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to soften with the menu entry Correcise Soft drawing and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove gauss's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; arteftequot; - small standards that are seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Beating.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can cut like a photo with uniformity noise reduction.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures are reduced to an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts caused by scannerlighting and photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicode; tool Hotpixels allows image pixels of photos that have been removed with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPxi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard by button DarkPicture. the tool will auto-detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the corrected image. an auto-processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and a long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicode; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise blur effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">It is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter with the large exposure range of today's film and color or gray area depth of digital cameras and film scanners. the tool Vignetting correction turns the transformation with a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regimen you can control the vignetting correction filter and three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which is equivalent to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly of a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar rounding effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grade corrects the remote corners towards that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tonal distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth gradient. this value appears more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the opposite character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resets the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog illustrates the distortion corrections. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonal or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all blanking or size changes. best perform this correction first. if you cut a picture and then perform a tonne correction, the effect would be obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction you can provide this tool a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transform Edit menu or via the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs, such as shots from the front, frame and paintings is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating the Infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters for film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO-Regulator changes the amount of film grains and the dominance of green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infra-red film, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter image applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; Filtration Filter is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film granulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular sight specially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although higher values are often required, on ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film granulation effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and this processed the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. smoothing controls the smoothness or, from the other side seen, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machining is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel big picture is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage model. the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: splits the image into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Beating.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpened: blurred the image along star shaped lines that radiate from one point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photos, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by a random shift of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart blurring: finds the paint tank in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this makes it natural to your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow along with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the visual effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digiplug; image processing to hold a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter rain drops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen Filters. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the painted image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirroring or rotating in the right direction. you can find the tools in the Transforming Turning or Transforming Mirrors menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of picture quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose Transform size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. split interpolation to increase an image. & digikam, uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintaining aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the original image aspect ratio will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose. each insertion for photo magnification can be saved as text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Beating.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles when a small color image has been enlarged to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together an image. to cut a photo you have to create with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut away. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be covered by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply drawing with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Ctrl button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X).</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog stays with it.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool after aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in the portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can see, for example, a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically centre the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool next time, these settings will be displayed as standard values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the settling help make it possible to blend aids, so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangles: harmonious triangles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third angels, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden mean is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden mean.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the observer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that distracts the eye into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles also derive from the above discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonals can be placed more dynamic on these lines.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal reflect and vertical options can be used to reflect the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, it is easy that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can repair this with the & digiplug; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose Transforming free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can reset the slide to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have turned a picture you will find undesirable triangle holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transforming cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is the Automatically Cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the image slightly after turning. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle on the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle on the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly lubricated. for a single adaptation, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double the effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transformations cut out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. for example, the upper part of the image is shifted to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not rotation, the image is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press forward presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shearing tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shear, the image is blurred a bit. for a single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two sheings generating twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing, the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate these is to cut the image with transformations cut out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>

<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images. redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam.</seg>

<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the state of the filter on the current picture. left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">The left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally split without duplicate. the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">Divide horizontally. the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'Mouse over 'style: shows the preview when the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons you can turn on to show overexposure and underexposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview. preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are marked.</seg>
<seg id="711">The properties tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data originate from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This rider provides an intuitive map finder based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or move it and move it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your pictures contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The palettes that are installed by & kde can apply either for the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your Personal Folder for & kde; -Settings and hot Custom Color and Recently used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog box, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders to files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described below the palette. here, the color-name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select. to create such a selection, click the area next to a color to move the cursor to there. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box Beim Cursor is enabled under the color button, the color will be inserted from the color chart on the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrites a different one; depending on whether the mode overwriting was selected. this mode can be set by selecting the tick box overwriting under the cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created as described in the last section, can be used along with the actions Copy, Cut, and Paste.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in clipboard: for each color three values for the shares of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line mark, if another color follows. if there are three numbers in the clipboard, these can be inserted as a color in & coloredit;</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphiviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that & graphviz; includes, are outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; -programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; -project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphiviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -Graphic. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphiviewer; displays graphene with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & Posters; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & ards; recomputed the graph and in & kgraphiviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & ards; to open or to open the graphene in & kgraphiviewer; in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 knot and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kgraphiviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for displaying the graph. you need in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you run & kgraphiviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like at the bottom of the screen:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; -button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you can see the maximum reduction in a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file is currently edited by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphiviewer; you can also remember that later. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings...</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a Graphite file outside a running & kgraphical viewer; eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice of whether you want to open a new & kgraphical viewer; or want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change them with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice of both saved and later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to divide the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be selected freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">When you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph, which come to a page, should be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewed Store site gives the option to determine the behavior if a file has been modified on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphiviewer; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the option to set the startup behavior of & kgraphiviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked at any start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears on a single click in the main window with the & RMBs, opens up further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge crossings as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for non-linear graphs. it produces representations according to the spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a spring model layout for uncoated graphs. it uses the Fruchterman-Reingold-Heuristics, and includes a multi-lattice for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circular to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should display the graphite file as parameters, and specify the calculated layout of the graphene after stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; the & graphviz; -algorithms specific options, or even modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for fluted graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview is displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module provides images to read and store new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images of a scanner that supports the SANE project or another source such as video streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and SANE installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you scan the menu entry images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by setting the default abrhe standard values to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the Scannen button. the estimated file size will show you in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is displayed completely, as some settings might not be shown otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button scan you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create the image to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected in the Importable &gt; screen shot menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select Complete Desktop to read a single window below the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program window is selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible place. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you have to switch to other workspaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screen shot is made, the dialog box appears with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo administration on the Internet. Flickr is able to show his photos to the people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token, which is used for your authentication. it is virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is started to enable you to log in with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr Website. the following page will be presented following a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking Yes, you will see the dialog for uploading photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which shows the current access permissions that the module displays. at present, you need not any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add images should be pressed once you set all other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr Server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillie options, you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you select the option to change the size of the photos before upload, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered by Maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The geographic location KIPI allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic localization module provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlation. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to provide a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. this file, of course, contains data taken at the same places at the same locations as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file loads an automatic correlation that shows coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the timezone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one location for pictures you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have matching data. if you know that in reality a location is in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. choose the region in question and enlarge it. always repeat this until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a Picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can choose the albums you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will encode UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that should be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab shows the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option for each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the picture will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow,</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have read permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab preview images allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album Rider for preview images, which are small images displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window will show the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred during the creation. the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery. press Enclosure to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI viewer viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with short commands and tricks. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size is rising, since there is no compression of the color information. this can be found in the PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the destination image.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please check iViv2, to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoding Engine is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MJpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a basic image transfer. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. after that, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you must select the corresponding PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds the image is displayed. the speed of the image transition is set below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you provide an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. once you have adjusted all settings to your wishes, you can start the production of the movie with the button Coding. depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show once you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that coders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MJpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing Gimp. this is for example: make sense to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file which is to be converted and run the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them otherwise you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to override existing file automatically. however, this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all the images in an album. it uses the convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images window will be displayed with the images you presuppose. you can add more images through the button Add images. for the last selected image, a preview is shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Removing images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client by clicking OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't forget to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of emails sent. it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the lossless formats like TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is done, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. by closing the closing button, you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced slide show, a window with questions like you want to show your slide show will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option allows the file name of the images to be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly choose that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time gap between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose. randomly select another effect in each transition between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen, you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date is currently no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have marked your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse with & kPhotoalbum; by these browsers, see picture. as you can see by comparing with the image, are now present in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have submitted your images and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you click on the entry with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select another person, only the images shown on which both individuals are displayed are displayed. this selection method allows you to limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to some single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all people, places and other settings, you can view thumbnail images to view images from your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kPhotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, that is of course also true for locations, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to define which image is to be displayed for each individual. to do this, you must select the image-view window (described in more detail) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu. in the view window, you can adjust the image for the corresponding person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or clipped.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you access the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can preview this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the labeling or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you wish, you can also enter a date to search for; the date may be either part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, images on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are shown.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kPhotoalbum; if you don't like reading manuals, but rather want to try some features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kPhotoalbum and take a look at the quick entry, screenshots and introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kPhotoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog if you start & kPhotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kPhotoalbum; -Demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of & kPhotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kPhotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kPhotoalbum; see the timeline. you can see a picture of this bar here:. as the name implies, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">Each bar displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview list) and also the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will only see images of this period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kPhotoalbum; provides you with two options to create HTML web pages with your images. the one is in & kPhotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; built-in version that you can create via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you have to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and goal. in the following, each area is described more closely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kPhotoalbum; HTML sample pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose if a & kphotoalbum; -export file should be created that is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer, even without description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. note that & kPhotoalbum; currently all images are exported. therefore, you can not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 will not download any images, such as a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time that you have set. so, he can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he wants to get an image larger he switches to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">For all your HTML files, select a basic folder and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they really are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages are created, will start. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created aren't yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. to enable the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kPhotoalbum; come together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time recording the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kPhotoalbum; this work does not even make one more time.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kPhotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. they can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored in the file themselves or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can join all the pictures and pass this file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you have provided when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the File Exports menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you want to copy manually to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically Copy to the .kim file copy & photo album; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, because the .kim file would otherwise be very large.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Imports... select, & kPhotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing wizard consists of four steps. first you have to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is called persons in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories correspond to those in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the files to be imported using the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and look at pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you look for example pictures of your Italian vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it, you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) Specifying the information about your images, about (2) browsing and viewing, through (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but frequently this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kPhotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the topmost folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kPhotoalbum; remember the folder where your images are stored and automatically re-use it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kPhotoalbum, then you can start & kPhotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kPhotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kPhotoalbum; set up... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kPhotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the various settings will be explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you can see six different symbols with which you can access the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access the F1 button and click on the desired option by pressing a button.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories have already been mentioned in the section. in the dialog Options you can set up complete members groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group will be set up in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kPhotoalbum; share its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & kPhotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of several applications are used together, it may be that the modules were tested with & kPhotoalbum; therefore, you should first test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kPhotoalbum do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kPhotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums: there is an album just a folder. even if & kPhotoalbum; this kind of order doesn't support it simulates it for some modules the order to albums so that you can use the functions with & kPhotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, that is, all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & kPhotoalbum, the modules also have a list of albums. here goes and kPhotoalbum, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kPhotoalbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kPhotoalbum; so do, so if you had selected people to view it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kPhotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the modules that you want to load.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kPhotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see a menu and toolbar on top of the toolbar. at the moment, it does not contain a lot of information, as you do not yet have information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kPhotoalbum; is the possibility to add any picture with notes. this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture, where the image is taken, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if illustrated on all pictures Jesper and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kPhotoalbum; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can, by that the names used are moved upwards, find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive an alphabetically sorted list, click the icon for sorting after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected pictures and add these images with notes. in this case, simply click the above and back buttons that are located on the right-hand side of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the U.S.. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a hypertrophy. to show you that it is a group, a special icon will appear.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. additionally, you can also drag an entry into a category and place it in order to make it an subcategory of this entry. note, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of annotation dialog by clicking and moving the lath that forms the upper edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which offers you, among other things, the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to get this window shown later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide the window. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or of all pictures if you have no filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnail images by simply drawing the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the image viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete the Edit menu. now the window will show you that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kPhotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use it with & kPhotoalbum; namely, you need to have the pictures stored somewhere, so & kPhotoalbum; you have to record the pictures somewhere, so & kPhotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures of which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the images 5-9 the preview images are available, so & kPhotoalbum; you can't view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back. & kPhotoalbum; so please don't support it to avoid inserting the CD in question. so, if you would like to avoid the mess of your images, please buy a larger hard disk to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures in such a way that in the end those who wish to make you inaccessible to others click on the menu entry All in addition to the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images to be hidden. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply choose password change in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please note that this image protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other, anyone who can access the index.xml file can read or delete the password as unencrypted text.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can manage all your pictures with & kPhotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason, & kPhotoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from previewing as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he obviously shows the picture, but additional all the information you have about the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and discard elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. the then appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see matching entries for this. if you click Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image above and down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and the end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kPhotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl button and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kPhotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can enter the image and zoom out. for zooming, you can simply pull out a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key, you can zoom in again. the plus button zooms in to the center of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the outcome of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. by means of the parity button, you set the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out-out with the plus and sub-key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turning functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set on the image. at the moment you can view the image abort and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name. however, you may prefer to highlight just the image and look at more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you see one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in this you see an image where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, they are available to you in your browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print, or whatever you have always selected, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you can display categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature, after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the picture you can see a picture on the painted. to turn on the painting mode from & photo album; on the picture you can draw on the picture from the context menu. to end the painting press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully mastered, but the documentation on & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the sub-object of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar, or select a menu entry in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar to Edit, or from the right-click context menu, you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message with a fault description will be displayed. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or discard the changes with abort.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already includes the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in tag view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wiredesign view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the point of view of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when selected, or their level of view smaller or equal to the point of view selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle will display the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the connection to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views on top of each other, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the top of the flashcards in the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchoring, drag the hit on the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the chamfer bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the chamfer bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with the View window order... Store. a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Rendering icon Rendering the icon Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry View Scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When clicking on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render Modi menu, the following dialog is opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to use a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the picture, select the cross section and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality, you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection illumination. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel, different errors can arise. these images often have a moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, compute and connect & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling describes the neighboring pixels with include.The second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because each pixel is continuously split up and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which can be tracked separately and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that creating noise for the beam process called jitter. if you turn on jitter, change & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a Povray, select the menu entry File Imports... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet full command scope of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for Povray. this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste into & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height-field data) in paths to & Povray; -Libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type license plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object string of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross High Details on extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections. this property results in better approximation for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is displayed in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you activate Kantenglättung, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used to render the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window instructions section explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and selected views with the button removal.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with Unten you get a map view together with the previous view and floats the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You'll need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; start with a simple scene. to follow this instruction, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit deletion menu.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The view of the scene from the view of the camera shows you the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the outcome of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the title camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the User Documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera sees control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (inserting infinite body quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wiredesign view now also shows the level, even at the moment only as a finite finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scale, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should shift the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog box opens in which you can choose how to insert the object. please choose first subobject. the pigment will then be displayed in the property panel. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matte black material, because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see color on ader and ball in preview, just click on the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your picture now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. select the item color list in the object tree. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Each time you choose the object tree, select the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to perform this step as you have already understood the fundamental working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the user button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the floor as you moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course rendering is a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first sub-object and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on sphere Pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the screenshots below and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The shine effect and reflection settings are already partially good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metal: not yet chosen:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene that needs to be rendered will need some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">Once you have saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last saved time are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you haven't saved any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the most recent command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting of & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, the shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new short instructions for & kpovmodeler with this option; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface separately and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel-based, by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the & LMBs, or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in an own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog Builder & kuickshow; there are five card cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; in the two other, short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser, the shortcuts for the respective windows can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point activates, loads & kuickshow; already the next picture in the folder while you still look at the current picture. this reduces the delay when you select the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option stores & kuickshow; when operating the name of the last opened folder. at the next startup, & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click the colored bar to select a background color. it is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if the window is larger than the picture in the window mode, the background will be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuickshow; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option, the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">To change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field. default setting is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">If this value is set to 0, the slide show will be repeated until it is canceled by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider respectively the small arrows to the right of the input field. default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Change the shortcut for the different operating modes of & kuickshow; in the flashcards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option, switch between the two-part view of the filesystem (a window for the subfolders and a window for the files) and the one-part view of the file system with folders and files in a window.</seg>

<seg id="1165">You can check the status of your scanner on the SANE project page by typing the necessary information on this search page: HTTP: / / www.sane-project.org / cgi-bin / driver.pl.</seg>
<seg id="1166">A standard scanner can be placed on the command line of & output; with the command hulite -d [device name] in the terminal. if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified, a dialog is opened to select the scanner.</seg>
<seg id="1167">The user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner.</seg>
<seg id="1168">The other settings contain more detailed driver options. & guinea; (libksane) does not treat these options in particular.</seg>
<seg id="1169">To scan a picture, the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan. the preview can be started by the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1170">In order to select the image better, the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection. it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window.</seg>
<seg id="1171">When the image is selected, the final image can be read with the scan button.</seg>
<seg id="1172">If before saving a preview in the settings is selected, then the image will be displayed in a preview window, as shown below. when saving is pressed, then the image will be saved and paraky will lead to a demolition and you will get back to the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Through the button Settings, the same name dialog is opened in front of the main window. you can change the most important settings here.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The user can view the image, if desired, before saving. in this case, the option must be selected before saving a preview. if this preview is not desired by the user, then the option must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1175">This setting allows them to select the way & output; images save them. dialog to save for each image opens the dialog in front of every scanned image. if & output; this automatically should be stored with a generated name in a pre-defined folder, then you need to select Save without asking for a file name.</seg>
<seg id="1176">This setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without having to ask for a file name. if the images are stored after each scan, then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving. the default value is your home directory, and you can change this with the button... change.</seg>
<seg id="1177">This parameter defines an image prefix for the automatically to save images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving. the automatically stored picture gets a numeric suffix that is counted up each time a picture is saved. the string # # # is replaced by the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1178">The user can adjust the image quality used for saving. this value also changes the compression value when saving. if choosing the image quality is not selected, then the default value of Qt is used.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Button Help starts KDE help with the & output; manual. button About starts the KDE via dialog for & channels; the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to end & output.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You can set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as & Amarok; -short instructions. this will make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are usually found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP features of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists, and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script can't be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are available and use kDialog, so the user knows why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kstrip indings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kebox --sorry' # {error} 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all current scripts. to do this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continually monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, further information on the new piece (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle To Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry was clicked. submenu and itemtitle are also used to remove the script from the dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemtitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; closes, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to perform cleaning tasks such as storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with the Ersweeping Aquamarscript. for this reason, you should name your script packets right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki Skrilas Page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. you might even search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collective Browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can't decide which one you want to hear? then the playlists browser is the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. these and many more useful functions make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake, you should not have any trouble when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiling options, certain dependencies need to be fulfilled so that they can be used. for details, see the System Requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Enables debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in the development of & Amarok, you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without trouble using the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition, if the option is off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser from & Amarok should be started when a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Using other browsers, you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save playlists when moving, the current playlist will automatically save when moving & Amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths to manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, are stored. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To keep the current piece visible when changing the piece, the playlist window will pop up / unroll to keep the piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the context to the context browser, the context browser automatically displays as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can adjust the look & amarok; the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok. by selecting Custom Writing, the otherwise gray displayed section is activated. you can choose fonts for the following area: playlists windows, player windows and context browsers. click Select... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the user-defined color scheme, you have the source of choice and can set your own color scheme. use the color selector activated, for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume play when starting, that & Amarok; after program start, resume playback automatically with the piece on the spot, with which it has been stopped at the end of the end.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Set up on-screen display allows you to turn on the OSD. when using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shown in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the OSD colors for font and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if your own colors do not use, the pre-set & kde; colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering placeholders, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is designed for Xinerama users, allowing you to determine which screen of a multiple monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box. some drivers still activate additional settings in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection, including the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes to insert how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Search for subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok to search both the selected as well as their subfolders to music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor Changes: allows & Amarok to monitor the selected folder to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, incremental searches are performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists in your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further device is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; under computer: enter the computer on which the MySql database is located. after that, it is entered under port: the network port under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data required for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The card file last.fm provides the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and make music recommendations as needed regarding the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and thus update the profile: this setting allows it & Amarok; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieve similar performers: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list of similar performers to the played piece. you can view the list in the context-browser. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will, for example, prepare difficulties. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by typing in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Usually this is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. the support for this in & Amarok is somewhat more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all libraries used by & Amarok are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib was compiled with GCC 3.3.X, this will result in crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatic. switch off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically at a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta info, but they do not mark the Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl: "the file $ARP [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARP [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error in writing the tags of $ARP [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) always look active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects will be removed in grey and semi-transparent. note that in some cases, you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarangapp: symbol lookup error: amarangapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KsystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliding Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several ways. most installation problems are easiest to solve by means of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC at irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to look for help. please insert only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only an empty playlist appears. how do you get music there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the start subwindow has been converted to the statistic window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the rating column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Display Review. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the review for a piece. you can also use the short instructions Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the alsa-sink, the device must provide a mixer. a blender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (Software Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify a different ink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server with the highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>

<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you have to register all the components. follow-register to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish Amarok before!): - Download mpeg, compile and install it. then execute list scripts, once as system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all the mpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with auto-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1325">Listening to music should be quite simple! for this reason, there is an instructional wizard that will appear at the first start of & Amarok. if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards, or simply do not like the wizard, this quick start guide will help you. with its help you will have set up & Amarok; in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag entries from the collection browser into the playlist. the small text box to filter the collection makes it easier for you to search for specific pieces. if you are happy with the playlist, you can save it by using the button playlist, save it. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the option to import playlists, you will be able to view various ways to load the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, select Actions Audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format. drag the wav files into the playlist and then press the playback button.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The audio CD function uses the protocol Audio / d: / and is not compatible with all available drivers.</seg>
<seg id="1330">The Burn function is also available in the playlist. just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the Burn menu. you have several options for burning a CD here.</seg>
<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. additionally, some additional packages are listed, which make work with & Amarok easier.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages using a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important features. in addition, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and Sampling rate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time to the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzer, even under the running text display. you can change through the available Analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the Player window. click on your keyboard and the current Analyzer will be displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display, the PL and EQ buttons are also located. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all available for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that don't exist in any other player. but don't let the wealth of functions deter you, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays different information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context-browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreters. these three subwindows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindow Start has dropped off. the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok; furthermore, the information in the statistics window can be viewed (extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow provides information about the currently running piece, as well as the performer and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this subwindow displays information on the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, performer and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to look at the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz icon you will find more information on the current piece. you see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats are supported by .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png. the context-browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last area, albums of the performer, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. when you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing right away. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using scripts written by itself. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if not yet a text script is running, you can choose which to be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. there is no running text script required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouping only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First, the pieces are sorted by artist and below will be a further split after the album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Interpret / Jahr - album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection will be sorted alphabetically among each other. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will be sorted by genre first and then by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust the grouping at will and combine.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings for the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter is a selection box, with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can choose from various time windows, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Loading - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on one entry, you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This feature will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">For media players, add the pieces into the queue for transferring to the media player. see the section on the Media Player browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - this will send the selected pieces to K3b and burn them either as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not appear.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialogue for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move the files in the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Undo collection marker - Changes a recorded album back into a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be shown under different interpreters but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser is easy to handle with many playlists. among other things, it also includes Smart Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Also created Smart Playlists are possible. click Smart Playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart Playlist. there you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & Amarok; to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; if & Amarok; Start, find the pieces on your iPod to performer sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. this way the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. when the transfer is finished, stop & Amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The tool bar is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not meet your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, you will find an address bar with which you can get music from a entered URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the music .tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simple dropping. in this case the holding of the Shift key can be useful: thus dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the pieces attached to you to play. you can change the order by simply entering the entries with the mouse to the desired position. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed. to reset the filter, press the button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter keywords separated by spaces, search & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you type one two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR 2 OR 3. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three are found (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then enclose the search term with goose bumpers: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not according to entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something does not contain something that does not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bathroom. this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key and then right-click on the entries in the desired order. the entries will then receive a mark with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button you can add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, enlarged analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example rendition controls and volume control. you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar flag in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. you can get the settings from & Amarok via this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1404">One click on this entry opens the window visualisation plug-ins. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok; select.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry is a sub-menu with links to this document and other information to & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can launch it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management includes a list view of all the albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to display in the cover administration. choose from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management got your big move into & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you set a piece to the queue, a number will appear next to the title. this number represents the order in the & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You can easily manage the queues via Tools Service Long Management. if you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are pre-set (the details to set up these will follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection, adding more random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: audio crobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you do not need a Last.fm profile to do this dynamic playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the playlist you want to play, drag them into the playlist window or right-click on you and then select charging. in this way, your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set pieces mix and playlist mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing right away. the playlist Recommended pieces begin with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece from your collection. the recommended pieces will be added at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as starting point. via the same menu entry, dynamic mode can be deactivated again.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New Fill button completes the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode. editing playlists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">With a right click on a dynamic playlist, you have the option to click Edit. after that, the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist here. however, the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist according to each played piece. if you set more than 1, the playlist will continue to grow, because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The right-hand settings have already been described in the previous section. on the left-hand side of the dialog, you can choose from existing playlists or smart playlists. when you cross multiple playlists, & Amarok; add random items from each of the selected playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts enable their own settings. you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on Setup.</seg>
<seg id="1425">You can install new & Amarok scripts by clicking on the script. a selection dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation. after you have installed the script, a new entry will appear in the list. you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file. alternatively you can only create an image of a CD, which you can then burn later on. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This allows the copying of a DVD to another medium even without a project file. alternatively, you can only create an image of a DVD, which you can then burn later on. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to record all the (video) data of the source medium in its original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog for deleting a CD-RW, so you can delete all content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog, you can format a DVD ± R (W), so the content is completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between writing modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burn a previously created CD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then immediately be burned by pressing the Burn button. (Nero * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, but you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burnt immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used anywhere. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings, and even possibilities to change the size and trim black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">This information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars from & k3b; when an entry is selected, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its content is displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as Media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headline has no real function, it looks pretty and disconnects the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window for modifying key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key signature for it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings from & k3b; here you can make general program settings. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is meant to personalize and fine-adjust the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, so your taste and the type of your task is more important, which of the attached programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you are using the dcop command line. to use the & DCOP; functions you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void Copyright Cd () void formatnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burndimage () void burndimage () void copyrights ()</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void createFolder (Qstring name, QString) void addUrls (Qstring path) void removeItem (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, QString NewName) void setter volume ID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCD Project) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT / home / truschi / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -readout for & kde; with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in wav files on hard disk) and by many coding files that encode these wav files (compressed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read out and saved in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) compress into the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggable (for OGG) or other coders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to codeners, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bang any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device can handle the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setup only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily use to read a & CD is explained. this (hopefully) will guide you to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which codes are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, with everything being recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. step by step, you will find more information on how this program is used, as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB will start the request of the CD-data according to the creation of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the coding Settings tab in the setup directory - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, allowing the selection to be read with another encoder as the default. it should be noted that before the encoder was configured in the setup dialog in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager, so an already read file is selected to encode instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages (such as protocols, pipses) for program events (such as read out the & CD; quit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & KaudioCreator; with different flashcards (like encoder, for setting up encoders). here you must go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, codeners and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are others such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly any commercially available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression according to their psychoactive model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bitrate the differences become less important, since both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is delivered with most distributions for free, but there are open licenses questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good Genug for music of teenagers, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without considering the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched through the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be passed / needed with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoder explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch must be added by lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & KaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that you can download and enter the information instead of entering the computer. it is to be noted that here only the text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I'm not lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information released publicly on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a bumper through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; actively select a check box (sending one address). for the use of freedb can be used with a different (fake) address than the one in the system. in this kind of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually made monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read wav files, the ename and the desired file format can be selected. first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other codes can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. further information on Kodierer is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio coders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">Both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can, for example, be found with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy something to the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & KaudioCreator; something that is probably done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each end & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding of the music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program with the freedb to download the & CD; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any readout of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the true device name of your disk. if this does not work or if there is more than one & CD; / DVD drive available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM, and / or DVD drives can be used.</seg>
<seg id="1553">There is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left as left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information can be selected, so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and leave the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server during reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry found, starts immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and file name will be changed with konqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, you can continue to note: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use this twice. to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how do the system know which data the CD should get? read the section about freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, but as many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 as standard, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to send data to the freedb server. deactivating the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number at the same time: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard the last piece: check this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must the path / folder be specified in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files are created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something yourself with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting tags to V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' Tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoding WAV files: with a dual score or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine, you can try to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & KaudioCreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk runs. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been described in the previous section, as we are comfortable and want to fetch the data from the freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data obtained for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; enter data manually instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this sample is to be found. it is a 'special' output of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, consult the FAQ section for the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there will be a window, and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'current title' field, the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the 'Actual title' field, unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with uppercase letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what is & audio creator; this option is set on the tab settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see help to the Kodiver to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the end-to-end CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not anyway forward the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org's website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK', return to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when downloading the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the unit list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece into or out. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the button All items selected at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process is started by clicking the button Selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Rider orders to turn on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will show you if you are trying to work with a codiver that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been encoded successfully are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select opening... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window into the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the & kmid; (with several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows left and right of the Tempograph and change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar, like a print on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the piece, interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, start & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text events, others use song events and other both. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the Ereignistyp is automatically determined which uses a song, so you don't have to set anything manually. so, if you select the entry automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the Karaoke text will be automatically selected.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an Ereignistyle p, select the entries text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you compose. these are played in sequence. in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click here in New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set each item in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not stored. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button Add a song. it again appears to the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically adding to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the pop-up sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump vice versa a song back, select the button Preview piece, the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates General-MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of type Change patch to Trumpet, making a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section which may appear as often as desired. however, it is necessary that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the Keymap"... END Define keymap "another key map..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that default is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that I can offer support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general-MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how General MIDI Patches can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all the tones that this instrument needs to lay on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gunshot (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gunshot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gunshot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this refers to the drum patch of the patch, where each tone represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions channel. see for example the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map out some channels to others. for example, if you want to switch the first and second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the key map with the name will be used for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that will change the patch on this channel will be ignored. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBender Ratio will indicate in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-benefit event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed only. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM announces that a keyboard which receives a pitch-benefit event is supposed to play a tone higher with the value 4096. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; try it around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the Dialogue MIDI Settings. you will find this in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played right now.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played sounds. in the View menu, select the View menu view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The Tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support it has been compiled. to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree that supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, activate automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; - Desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI-folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or tacked (if I want to play a karaoke file), just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, turn the setting Automatically add to the collection, and the new one; file is added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. Only you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, I encourage you to program on & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have much time for my hobbies but I try to collect MIDI files, make music and prove phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlers @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">They make me really happy when you send me a postcard from your place or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will list under Friends of & kmid; but you should contact me as I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and doesn't get any money from anyone. I would like to stress that I only continue programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it's not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the main view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the menu bookmark, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries played after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level. if you click on an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and persistent playlists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / directory can also be changed from the View menu and next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the same playlist from the menu list and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the ease of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No intro = 0-option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it will automatically stop by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; Body; & lt; lg dur = "ing dur =" file: / / / home / koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet; & lt; / Body; & lt; / Body; & lt; / Body; & lt; / Body; & lt; / Body; & lt; / Body; & lt; / Body; & lt; / Body; & lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here the path can be set from the MPlayer and the intermediate storage size of the datestroms from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, like setting up the backend using mimetype. here is an example of how a flash disk is played with the swf cozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even insert the special embed field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file Assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & SME; is to run in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. the stripping process is called crapplayer. if there are no errors here, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order for a given back end to be taken for a particular mime type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SME; can play cards from TV, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do so, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog is to be used in the Settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be found ports from which one is selected. the code to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, different names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introspection, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlatives, vcdsource and vedsource. if enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any clues how to quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is to be executed as a user root after the device is inserted. it is essential to ensure that / dev / cdrom can be found on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1751">While there is only one good oversight to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book on this. to be able to control & latex, good books e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: Document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ documentationclass, the body starts with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick-entry Wizard of & Kile; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (MenÃ ¼) provides some options for creating the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this is the kind of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [book], report [report], article (DIN) [scrartcl], report (DIN) [scrtypecl], book (DIN) [scrtypecl], [beamer], foil [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: the character encoding of the system is set. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex; for integration, they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with the German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is just a short description of the functions and further information about it will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - just like other source text editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you want to see green areas of a green text on the screen, it is most likely that any mathematical environment is not closed. however, it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic completion of the environments, typing a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for typing the text) and the corresponding line for closing the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be deactivated in the menu settings box; set up LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows to divide the document into the following elements (part is the highest and sub-paragraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files the recovery search can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [file-dependent file (engl. D e V ice I nanoFile)] was created, jumps & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the standard output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools to view, convert and print DVI; -files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the retrieval search, the elements of the DVI; file are bound with the editor and once clicked on an element in the DVI; file is the exact opposite of it. as soon as you clicked on a section in the & latex; source text, it will jump to the appropriate position in the DVI.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. a project-wide master document can be set to project settings when using a project.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI file, in the case of the slingâ s, is used, and there is no call from & ocularity; after quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the toolbar, the three large selection boxes should be noticed. the selection boxes were developed for speedy insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for speedy inclusion of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box for more is to add items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified term (selection via a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; and & kbib;. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -files can also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ eue is used for defining font sizes. font sizes can be specified for the main text, footnotes, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and maintaining the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentate contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font sizes. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is using the MenÃ ¼ s building or the button of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; it will automatically execute the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. if it is not the case, the logging should also be followed automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with font sizes e 12 is created, and only a few words should have a different font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are carried out only within the environment (from\\ begin} environment} to\\ end (environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold prints, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italic pressure and is until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ ratio: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; label language is presented, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, there should be a few adjustments for the better readability of the document. for this, a quote, a few places in bold and cursive pressure and a poem should be applied to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor's view or Ctrl E can be converted back to the editor (with internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file is created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I n dependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps are needed for creating the document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is properly set).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion to other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a suitable setting for all & latex; -Binding files. to do this, you only need to set up Modern under Settings box... Tools can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the pretext search, the cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on pre-selection search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then placed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. for this, & Kile; in & Okularline; as text editor.</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should a failure occur when using the & DVI file, an error may occur. if there is an error, this will be summarised in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file records the source code in the source code. in the editor, the buttons can be used for errors LaTeX errors and NÃ Â LaTeX errors for jumps between the errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. in order to look at the faulty row, the error must be clicked in the log and & box; jumps to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you click on the button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting the empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard can be used for creating a new document. more information about this can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Ufige users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be opened or a new file must be created. & Kile; can create a new template using an existing document and select file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings box... settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by typing in document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentate class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$].</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex files. if a simple way to create a template, you should search for one on the Internet and follow the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Posters; as an internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & ards; and its options should be tightened the manual to Kate. users of & Kile; can begin there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; offers a very practical & latex; -command reference that can be called via the MenÃ © LaTeX Reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex, as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with the trl key to select the & tex; that means that in this way you select\\ par\\\\\\\ par\\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">If the arrow keys are used, parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; it has the possibility to search and highlight various kinds of source texts. for example, the & latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizards can capture additional hock marks. this is an independent type of bookmark inside the text. the menu items Edit Sprite marks or the respective button of the button have the possibility to jump to the next or last jump-mark. this also applies to this jump stamp, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a draw.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; although & ards; already excellent options added, in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; & latex; always enforces many environments and groups and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only exploitative thing in & Kile is that the abscesses are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning, as this command will also select & latex; -commands with a back layer (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Posters; offers the Ctrl; K key with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with its own commands for a faster option.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit select heel.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further orders under editing environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will skip to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the above-mentioned environment can quickly be lost. this command completes the most recently opened environment, so that the nested surrounding structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by parentheses {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that match those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is used to jump to the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curving clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will skip to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the cursor.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curvature of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many nested welded group brackets you can quickly lose the above view. this command completes the most recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex, two simple instructions are used as a guest. for the appropriate implementation, the character is used in & Kile; the character is used for two simple application characters. also for ending the implementation the character is used. & Kile; knows this case and for two complete guide signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insert of the double connection characters can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There can also be customized settings (e.g. wet or French) and therefore German or French license plates. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">If the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a spreadsheet environment, t & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with a subsequent line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added to boxes; set up... LaTeX can be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et-characters (amp;) to each other. & Kile; tries to achieve this. while pressing Shift, Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the next tab in the underlying line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although a good source code is already available, it was added in & Kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;), five different modes are installed. three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings box... Completely set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment by command\\ begin {environment} & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end} environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the return button is pressed, the last letter of the input will be removed and the complete list is enlarged. on the other hand, the list can also be scaled down by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be removed from & Kile, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible, and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; Completely you can make settings to these lists. you can select different lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as voice lists of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters to be entered with\\ begin and the call to completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completing environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the Completely Mode over the menu area, or the key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically checked and it will appear\\ begin {. after that, the surrounding area can be continued in the simplest way and be terminated by using the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been completed, the environment will be closed automatically. once & Kile recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of full extension mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>

<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode is introduced, the character L is replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large size records are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many weeds are written more than once in a document.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the box Settings box... Kile vertical down. here, the threshold for the display of the completion can also be specified.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is enabled, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To view the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are groupwise in the creation compiling, converting and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewers such as & eyepiece; or the further transformation can be used by pressing Alt; 2. after that, the DVI; file in the default size viewer can be viewed using Alt; 4 the DVI; file into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is. this is done by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) will appear fat after you are: text.</seg>

<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting is selected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; regularly creates backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next startup of the program the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>

<seg id="1966">In the Structural Settings section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty knots are empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the iflaw abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are part-applications from third side, which can be reused by each part-capable application, the best known and konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located in a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the related folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load the component in the "read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Lese-KParts usually refuse loading when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, then select it if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redesigned. support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, just like the support for the DBG debugger.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available that provides support for the use of inquantaplus; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the Debugger plug-in for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. using the button options next to the Debugger plug-in selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops are listed with time numbers and conditions. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower frame.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is produced, or it shares the plugin with to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. happens before a debug requirement has started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution will continue.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next command in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next command in the script, where possible in functions and include will be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Open a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered that is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog can input a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag files contain two file types, the & descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic guiding of image buttons (above the edit window), the text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow for quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing but folder. they only contain the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is presented in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but a single element of itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of the tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only be used once for each attribute. additionally, it contains the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>

<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source of data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day grouped together the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog box. this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements ending a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and need to be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but watch out & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause leg breaks, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is only done when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "class _ name" type = "class _ name" type = "optionally" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for editing DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = move 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action has been assigned to this action. by clicking the user defined button, a shortcut icon can be assigned; with Keiner, the current shortcut is removable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples from & quantaplus; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way tries & quantaplus; the script in the following places: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus, only one instance will be added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can take input from & quantaplus on the default input. in the input field input, you can determine what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected Text: the selected part of the document will be sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, sent to the standard output, by setting the value of the selected text output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you plan to use them, enable "Edit Tag" dialog when available so that it is possible to input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, graphic Show other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size to others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered to be los, starred, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user is signaled that clicking on this icon will insert a & lt; start the tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be associated with the action. this is done via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or it should be assigned to a better overview by some separators into multiple groups. open the toolbar setting dialog via Settings tool bars. make sure the required toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back to the right folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be installed impedifolder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please fit your descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) is loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most mentioned extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g., php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Section1.html Section 2 = Section1.html Section 2 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html, tag2 = tag2.html tag 3 = tag2.html day 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the section of the docrc file, which is used to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context-separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example, which documentation was used for the & quantaplus; repository for use by the & quantaplus, community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the fail resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via e-mail to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places, there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP), send the toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus, users can download it. contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. to make a good contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload, you are asked for your private GPG key after your passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New Resource, the input fields have to be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and Script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in tagua format could be needed. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Description: the string that is supposed to appear in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine tuning the DTEP after transformation: when enabled, & quantaplus; after transformation the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand them and to get full benefit from & quantaplus, you must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus. from toolbars of actions everything that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specially designed for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, allowing the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the flashcards with information and the toolbar. please check in and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as closing the current, other or all of the cards, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Rectangle in the Editor area leads to a further context menu on the edited document contents, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tag under the mouse-cursor, help the word under the mouse-cursor or open the file, if the string under the mouse-cursor is a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now, you can insert the data for this particular tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog box different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction prospects (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; navigate to open and roam them. in the presentation with antitrust boards are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation building views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool providing & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows administrators to manage files in the project using a right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be done with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on where they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; global templates are always available, local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here too. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can change attributes and namespaces with it. the application system aligned with the content makes it possible to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two leaders at the bottom of the window can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each in Quanta running script. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the check-up of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function from & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save it in & quantaplus, like any other store and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus. autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While striving to create the best & HTML-editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make him the absolutely most powerful web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why development, what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More details in the details are using help: / Quanta (either enter this URL in & konqueror, or run khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the template section. if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted when inserting from clipboard there are special characters to & html; enrolling, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard to & URL; -Selling, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages exist!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. that's the window in which you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Training and switching on the problem reporter at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter will be activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Forecast or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu, grouped by the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows, for example, to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; off and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project Dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions need to be stored by means of settings. toolbars are stored by toolbars toolbars or you will be asked when you are asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it doesn't delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities of the & DTD; It makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be replenished without renewing the entire & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist in the global KDE folder, the load will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu provides a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (html;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current Tag Settings dialog if there is one. this entry is always available in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inclusion means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar refuses to comply with the rules this day.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the menu items above. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on the type; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Very useful when you know people who are using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or cause unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting a entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar display at the bottom of the & quantaplus, main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; -web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & posters, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars, or which you can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse-pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus, development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, because, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift, F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering your name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Get hooked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profile or modified with the Shift key; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Complementary option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">Currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plug-in can be set using the button Options.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing a particular tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn event actions and add, modify, or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a certain event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, open & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog Project is displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus, the project file is automatically stored. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files will occur. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there you can manage the files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders do the same, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only more one profile exists, the button is blanked to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be stored in the core memory and forgotten in the end of the program. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure storage of the disk option is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high loading profiles can be created and uploaded to different servers for the project (or parts of the project). when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server's name on which the files should be copied. either a full-qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this doesn't have to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. it can give a lot of views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted by the Project Toolbar menu or the project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus, to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are tool bars in & quantaplus, best stackable via the tool bar. usage and addition are different. adding toolbars is treated at the bottom of the tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set using the context menu (right-clicking on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbars can be rename or toolbars can be executed, where it can be indicated which actions on these or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will also be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Toolbars... and set Settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus, basically uses templates like a common filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory existing to the system in the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be binary files except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. a simple scaffolding for the purpose and arranges the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates. see for more information on the Template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire web sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this happens, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the selection to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for such as pulling and dropping or pasting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project file tree view, select a name for the template and secure a name for the template, but of course it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very goal-oriented approach. you can pretend headlines and footers or dynamically link to & PHP; create, insert, or associate files with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in subwindows templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder in the template overview and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types described before; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded when parental attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder was set in such a way, it would disable templates in this path, unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-building block. if nothing appears, you'll probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows predictated or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be generic headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project, allowing for copying of content templates to a folder with special headers / footers a whole presentation already with matching headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you can use context menu (to show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source editor, which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to source code editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the undoing of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that at the same time the changes both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor are displayed synchronously. pressing F9 will activate this mode, if the button is activated, the active cursor is moved from one window to another, and the position in the document is retained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL, you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation applies: a small span for fast computers and a large apot for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to choose document properties. thus, editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. one click into the list allows the change of the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is used as usual. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves especial. the marking function as usual. text can be inserted through typing and deleted by pushbutton or removal button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way as the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it is to be noted that the insertion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor day, surrounded with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars such as the Sheets Assistant or the Listen Wizard are disabled. you will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps & kdiff3; while automatically selecting the correct changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge full folders. this screen shot shows & kdiff3; in folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and deals with the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check coders, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is the same and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, you can make typing easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -o Destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows manual typing of filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will notice your selection and show it next time. you do not have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders is initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C however a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to immediately set an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setting button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge process.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog, you don't have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar features. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3, and then compare it. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dragging of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color Green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription Edition:, the filename and [changes] when you edit the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons to the next dissolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows the group belonging to the line is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group is otherwise not visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more row left in the group by automatic merging or manually editing; this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source. this text will not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker you might copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side on, side off, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-End, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the default window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insert button, you can switch between insert and spelling mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-bottom / Ctrl-picture Abroad) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture Up / Ctrl-picture Abroad) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, differences between solutes and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl paste). if enabled, whatever you mark will automatically be copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted. be careful with this option because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved when loading and restored at the next startup. (menu Settings- &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the chosen script doesn't support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered astert. on these systems, the button Preferences automatically sets an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the input of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. manual copying to the clipboard is then omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which line-end type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first, to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. in this step, white characters are ignored. even when merging, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of one line, others in turn save a line feed character, but then files with different sizes may appear identical in the page-to-page comparison, though they are different. when this option is enabled, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow in very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful if white characters in many files are less important. if you need this only from time to time, then use the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge. see for details see Documentation to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be appended to suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you must & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set there globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for coding, a short note appears, which is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to set the output of pre-processing instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress changes in white characters in the text or view columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignored C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded oversight column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files. up-to-date file merge in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files. a simple click will start the merge and use the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first committed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. the output of the command is only used with the line balance. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program that by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newlines to convert the input into upper case letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\\\ 1 / 'This. * is a graceful expression of the found text in the first log pair. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>

<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for newlines. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so basically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER'However, perl needs some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and merging. further operations only change the data that the line balance algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes the text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively with & kdiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting</seg>
<seg id="2363">... simulating and simulating the simulated changes without actually carrying them out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you just need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged then folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder was specified, used & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message window of the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that have been compared to that point are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object, or by opening the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu includes two functions to fold all sub-directories and fold all sub-directories with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When double-clicking on a file, the comparison window will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the Details Pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As can be seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then, folders will also have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a file and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a file and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Syncing mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified, and if the option directories sync is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merging and storing the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B by A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New file is selected instead of merge (unsure), then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different but the same date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is executed after the other. you status column displays Fertig if the merge was successful, and corresponding other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis in the setup dialog, Kdiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the just selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a destination folder, then the three-folder merge-mode C is used as the target, for two-folder merging, B is selected as the target and for synchronizing A and / or B is used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by the specified entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select folder merging / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to just merge the current entry, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merge actions by conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options through, simulating and abort.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merge window opens (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select Start / Continue directory merge, or press F7. if you haven't saved it, an appropriate dialog appears. then & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to determine the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), & kdiff3, you will have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and do not merge them once again. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered as completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings - &gt; Def3 setup...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be more than one pattern entered, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be more than one pattern entered, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other filesystems, a preceding point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links show. this is downlighted in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links like normal folders are treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not include any potential recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a continuous loop and & kdiff3;) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the Date of Change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equally large. for example, this can be useful when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables syncing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the copy of the newer file as action is suggested (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed too.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merging view is visible while merging single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch the window divider to the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to simply compare a file by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO-slaves. KF3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relative and. or.. contained. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or the date of change deviate from the original. (note the option of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is at present as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start Kde3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In Cat Part Display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally it takes & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, & kdiff3; then & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program will recover to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exist. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part executed, it only supports comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it is compact) already exists. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff3 program from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or want to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably not announce the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure installed configure in / usr / local, but then KDE does not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line will not be treated as identical. if similar lines appear to each other, this will be the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required for this has so far been too large. you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text you should use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is sudden; No src is sweeping; no src has been released and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and lots of people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use KF3 on other platforms without KDE, please visit the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde3, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake uses, you should not have any problems with compiling. should you still encounter difficulties, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copies to the clipboard and clears the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders don't appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version of the program you will need to re-read the Update button after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">If the destination folder does not already contain these files, it will be missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later version of the program.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the Labeling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed again when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. various characters in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both within a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workspaces as well as the applications in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the motion is possible both within a desktop as well as on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu only has the two entries to set up pager... and terminate. if you clicked on an application within & Kpager, the symbol and name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximise, on desktop and terminating.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & Kpager, the names of virtual workspaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is intersected together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise, only empty working areas are displayed to enable them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the order of the & Kpager; -Main window can be determined: classic leaves & pager; in a 2xN-grid, as from pager applications appear in some other windows managers; horizontally, all virtual worktops are horizontal and vertical in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager-miniprogram in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, displaying and moving windows as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and then set up selector switch settings... allow the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the dialog box. but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you have no write permission for the file, you must login as user root or contact your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowtransparentMode and assign a value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">As & Kpager; part of the package kdebase, you will need a functioning installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; shows the enlarged section of the screen. in the following, this window appears as magnifying window. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as a selection window below.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, enlarged & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer is like a moving magnifier. alternatively, you can display & Kmag; for this purpose, you can view a selected screen area in the magnifying window (drop-drop mode) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer setting. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>

<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold down the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the contents of the zoom window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key, or use the & MMB, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; possesses a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Stopping or stopping the update of the ad. stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates one mouse click as soon as the mouse-cursor persists for a while on the same spot. it is intended to help people who suffer from RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury Syndrome) and which each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates one mouse click as soon as the mouse-pointer persists for a while on the same spot. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to clarify it once again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by mouse-clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movement and executes a mouse click as soon as you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates the pressing of the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement, before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must be petrified after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool executes a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligently shifting is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is active. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing down the mouse button wait before it lets you release the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse happens in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is activated, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. these movements will be saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ stroll.txt, if & kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the Rider General. there is a slide control sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">This setting is selected, will be started & kmousetool; at any start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings on the values that were set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings are reset to the state after the user's last indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with default settings. in particular, the smart move should be turned off first. if you are used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the smart moving.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to decrease in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of which places a mouse click is left without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse jerks, you should clean your mouse. it's usually quite simple. the trick here is that you don't just clean the ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse varies. however, it should be clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the wheels. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can easily scratched with a flat blade or a fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool, when a move is started. if you use the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer stop by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you do a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and use the cursor to another position.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to move the cursor to where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the title rows of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart moving, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is probably possible to select text to copy it to the clipboard, or to execute any other action when you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start & kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click on one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. later, you can use the smart moving even without the audible mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the XTest extension must be installed for & X Window; this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse cursor quickly as soon as the mouse-cursor resumes. this program was developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and which causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait for a specific time to start a pulling process before the mouse button is released. in this way, drag and drop can be performed using the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2532">On the first page of the wizard (left screen shot), enter the command that will later be used for text output of text. for more details, please refer to the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the standard text passbook. from the text passages, you can often choose text passages without typing them.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot) you determine the dictionary for word completion. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word. additionally, you can compare the word lists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to make only correctly spelled words into the word supplement.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a flow storage of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>

<seg id="2547">The word supplement page contains a list of words for the word completion. in the main window beside the input field shows & kmouth; a drop-down selector if this list contains more than one dictionary. with this drop-down box, you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion.</seg>
<seg id="2548">With the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of the books or export them into a file. below the list, you can select the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Select the desired language for this source; & kmouth; then reads & kde; -Documentation. the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence. in addition, you can compare the word list with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2550">With this option, you can merge the available dictionaries. & kmouth; ask which dictionaries are merged, and how they should be weighted.</seg>
<seg id="2551">With this option, you create a new, empty dictionary with no entries. da & kmouth; adding newly entered words into the dictionary automatically creates a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two. in the upper part, the text passages are displayed as tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the passage of the text or the respective shortcut. if you have selected a text passage book, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">Add actions like new text passages or books, or delete selected text passages and books, either via selection in the menu bar, toolbar or drop-down menu.</seg>

<seg id="2617">In & Conversation;, the IRC program of & kde; you can set up different types of messages; for example, set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IRC channel where your nickname occurs. with & ktts, you can then read the IRC message text.</seg>
<seg id="2618">Supports a & kde; -program KNotify, a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program. the possible settings for KNotify differ according to the application.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Filter for string replacement offer a good possibility in & ktts; to correct incorrect or faulty messages. the file kmail.xml, which is part of the scope of supply of & ktts, is a good example. it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by email, and also the expression / local / inbox, as this can be assumed in most cases as presupposed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Filters are processed in filters before they are sent to the speech-scheduler program. they are useful for improving pronunciation, to replace wrong spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker, or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filtering, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differentiates four types of text.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the screen reader edition is read, the retained orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after the issuing of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Breaking news interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses news. while you & eg; read a long text on a website, you can come with & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; notifications are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you use from the flashcard orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queues, except the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one reads them, this output is stopped and stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reactors. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters available.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the substituting parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; supplied with pre-defined label insertion filters, which allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for re-formatting messages; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Transforms use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. included in & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With subscriber-selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; if you have set a female voice on the flashcard speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it. read more about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it will continue to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, message, warning or a & kde; -notifications to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters created on the page below. the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of established standard filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are executed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the further below installation dialogs are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern for the set-up of string replacement filters. if these patterns are found in the text, the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it just has to be different from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is executed in the order displayed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here. click on the button to display a list of languages.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You get the application ID running programs with qdbus;. the & dbus; -Numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID number-3432 indicates, you may only type copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter when matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; print & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the package.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transforms translate & XML; using XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such implementations.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is reachable via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">You can send text to a certain speaker, set up on the speaker card, or to a speaker with certain features. for example, you can specify that text by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text passed to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected using the speaker characteristics that the program provides, which sends the text to & ktts, and the features of the speakers furnished on the card card. you can override the selected speaker with the spokesperson selector filter.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression. is on your system the & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can access it with one click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, that is, start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text matches the filter conditions above, the speaker will be selected to display the required requirements. click the button on the right to display the Speaker Selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your spokesman settings or delete all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The speech-scheduler program uses an adaptable module architecture for speech synthesizers. if you would like to extend it to another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSml and for the & XML; conversion filter but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including packages kdelibs and development files for the speech-scheduler program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts, from the source code archive for tag points or downloaded the currently created tarball, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktts, first check if speech-scheduler is working correctly with your speech synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; it uses the program speech-scheduler. the program kttmsgr should be developed so further that the setup of speech-dispatcher is possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into single sentences. the user can leave set or paragraph styles, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have a speaker, whose language is English and whose sex is female, it will be used, otherwise it will automatically select the best speaker. if you want to know more about how & ktts; a speaker selects, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add to Add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the box speaker setup will be displayed. for example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules you will find under.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival is included in PATH, you just have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the text encoding for text that is passed to the Festival. in the case of voices which are known & ktts, this setting is automatically done. generally, Western languages ISO 8859-1 apply, eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a few regulators and display this gray, the voice chosen by you does not allow these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that the first set is synthesized faster (with larger memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click to Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is kttsmgr at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, only the kttsmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr does not work, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this gives you the option to stop reading or otherwise control it.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of speech applications:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. once the screen reader has been read, the orders received will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News is the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can come with & kmouth; nonetheless someone who just walks the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning, or the output of a screen reader, it adds & ktts; the audio output enters the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played prior to the introductory message.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, sex of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of abbreviations. SSml is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male), since this is the default one, the festival is used in the output of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, SSml text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set limiter filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into single sentences. this can be faster with reading, since only the first set has to be synthesized, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the set limiter filters. at the first start of & ktts, a set limiter filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add more set limits filtering filters, but beginners will be advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the language selection is to try out the language selection. turn off the language selection, change some features and check how the speaker's choice is changed. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster to start reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then hold or break orders on the card card, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the standard set of rules is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut down, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limiter filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set limiter filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -messages (kV), warnings, messages, or the output of screen reactors.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limiter filter from default, you can re-paste it by loading the standard _ sbdrc file in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the Vocabulary Book of Speaker Selection, you can override the language settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the card speaker). in other words: no speakers are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of an established speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker, who is most likely to have the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to input the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired speaker here. if this feature doesn't matter, don't enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should take precedence over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a primary feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only way you might want to specify the attribute language is present if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one placed in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the area Spokesperson, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the default driver button and then use speaker that is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr will crash immediately when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I don't get tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is probably a non-compatible version of GStreamer. if the problem is not solved, it may be a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I hold a text order, freezes and ktts; one. on the & console, a message appears which states: Unlocked to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is the problem that conflicts occur in ALSA, which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. hints for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr doesn't show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festival.as a guide, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program must be installed sox and can be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizermoduls like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card card for speaking devices. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored if & ktts; & HTML; pre-reading. (this is because HTML is converted to SSml.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSml forming filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. thus, festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file turns into the conversion of SSml to Saber, the GENDER-tags. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string replacement filter and now I can do it in & ktts; no more set-up or back. on the card leader orders is displayed, the order consists only of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You may not filter interpunctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon).</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. be aware that the GStreamer modules are registered by running GStreamer in & ktts before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer .freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system also counts, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; also freezes if you hold a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read yet.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for general setting of speech speed but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install sox using the apt-get install sox command. the program is included on most & Linux; -CDs already included.</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good and there are several voices and languages supported. with many voices you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch with & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help find this in the instructions provided with the Festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice sets Festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software in festival / lib / click / russian. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) coding, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, seek festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, encoding must be set to an 8 bit cyrillic as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA, synthesizer. then, festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; this generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no full voice output system is. & MBROLA; generates language from Diphone files. you need additional software to create this Diphone. festival creates this by & MBROLA; needed diphone. txt2pho can also generate diphone from German texts.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this procedure, additional wrapper code is added to the Festival to use & MBROLA; -Voices for voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; -voice files will not be installed in the & MBROLA, but in the Folder Festival / lib /.</seg>
<seg id="2779">IMS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German & MBROLA; -voices. required is either Festival version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first install Festival and & MBROLA; then download the MS German Festival from</seg>

<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quellopher speech synthesizer written in & Java, i.e. you need to install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; neither pitch, volume nor speech speed can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktts; with any speech synthesizer, which can be controlled on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">Best use a command that writes the voice output into a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device.</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows the management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetwork.conf; create a simple interface for the user to perform the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetwork.conf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware can not be installed. physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured to make & knetwork.conf; the device at all indicates and allows setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded when the option Network Setting at the & kcontrolcenter; -index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be identified, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose from the distribution and the Releasestand best. by selecting the setting of non-recurring questions, the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed grey, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can enter system management mode at the right lower end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire module's functionality is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface... in the dialog Device setup.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In automatic mode, TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the manual, without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration can be done. in the IP address field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching off a switched-off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching off an activated network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking on interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Defines the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is by default used for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces a full domain description by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the name resolution part of the Reiter name resolution makes it easy to manage this list. entries can be added, removed or changed .DNS entries can be added to priority by selecting an entry and / or downgrading in the list with the knobs Hinder or Herunder.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the Add... from the group computer to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group computer to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display dialog Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The Named Calculator list describes hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list Nameal-known calculator contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP is to replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add New Alias dialog will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the known computer has multiple alias names, press the button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog friend computer is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system. to enable the changes, must be set in a & Console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The home page of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installing the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console, with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical user interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but additionally, the development packages are required with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second one will be discussed all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace advanced knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely used. IPv6 is expected to be used in the near future. therefore, this description is currently concentrated on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is allied. in other networks, on & eg; the network administrator is the contact point that provides a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose, to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, usually addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first one is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed loop.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This part contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL links, so it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections no other content will be found there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is handled by the scripts in SuSE. another level than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be integrated by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trot the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detect & kdat; don't recognize the prespann on the tape, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the prespann, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been incorporated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be browsed through aulettes of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be resolved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; specifies a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar. the band can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to save data. if your tape drives precedes that a tape has to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the tape of & kdat; floppy tape drives normally require formatting the tape, however, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After input of the band name and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the tape will be lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you set up the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a security profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Sichern menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog opens Settings for Backup. in this dialog, you can check the selected files once again and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Once you have confirmed the settings, the dialog box will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the volume with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu entry Verify....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the review settings, the dialog appears to check. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that are to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Rightclick a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index on the basis of the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can re-create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files on the same file system are stored, which are located on the same file system as the folder. folders located on other filesystems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Executing an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, sends & kdat; before the tape is inserted, the command will load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; block the ejection from the tape drive. it may not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the band automatically discards when releasing the & kdat; do not use this option at floppy Streamers.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system holds the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, tries to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup, try & ksystemlog; first, open the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or set strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as minutes lines of level indication. the color representation of protocol rows can be turned off setting dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can use the option To jump to new lines in the main window context menu, to display all the new protocol rows added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of several protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the Window Pane to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. dort you will find more current information about the Sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; find in the following folder des & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and so named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is rapidly becoming standard for the control of the program boot when the system runs up in the & Linux world. and that is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to system V init without reinstalling and re-formatting. the & Linux; kernel first looks under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another runtime. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail; system services, on the other hand, do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you don't have much use. you can also make a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, which has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for the program init at different places and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following in the beginning area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default running level is 3. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful when you make changes to the inittab.</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if a K contains, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level running only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user-run level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six Runlevel to launch it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runlevel' or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this only happens when you pull out an entry from the area of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them to a new level. in order to only copy them to a new level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area, even if the same entry previously existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the typing button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu will require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; otherwise they will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runleveling, and now the machine is constantly restarted. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in standalone mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE, or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary alignment programs of these distributions but is unfortunately not standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just end without message if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read chapter adaptation of & kuser; to start reading.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the respective icon of the toolbar or the entry stored in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space limitations (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card password management appears, if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears, if for at least one built-in filesystem space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the quota.user / quota.net file on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space limitations are in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected with space limitation with the help of the field filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups tab informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs, you will find in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. the editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boat manager, add, remove and change the boot password, add time to boot of the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
