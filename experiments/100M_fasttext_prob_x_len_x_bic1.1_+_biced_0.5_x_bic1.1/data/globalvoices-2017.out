although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely large .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , have danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American movie .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magnet , who wanted to occupy the top Federal Court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as it is said so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in favor of him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever attained .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes people from around the world , a deeply believing human being with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp does not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns playing at the game .
Tru@@ mp In@@ tolerance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for her life long for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the comple@@ xi@@ ties of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied in them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp was making his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , presi@@ ded a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either shared racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country they have disappointed ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down on those looking different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( WC ) : as much as &quot; Wh@@ ites revol@@ ving against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities . &quot; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash play on white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones , did exactly what America did so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp , however , a vast majority of the white America claims this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ aring the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concludes with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later , he was corrected .
the country for which his son fell , sent him a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now Tru@@ mp Land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the news . &quot; &quot;
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
the fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with its musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ al violence .
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with recycled instruments consisting of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers began to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez .
the instruments mim@@ ic violin , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all made out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in tr@@ ash The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio had shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Wa@@ ste Shi@@ p ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about 1 billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights against illegal fishing .
this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated underground fishing in the waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and less inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to dock one of their har@@ bours and refused to grant him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at his time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia due to pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative that protects criminal practices and protects resources was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters .
&quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
due to the deliberate violation of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail , with the information between individual countries , the actions nowadays happen in real time , with trace@@ ability on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there the individual countries , for example , can exchange lists of existing licenses , news of suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to mark ships fishing in prohibited areas - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such studies can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a criminal code .
on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means illegal fishing is not profitable any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover , which will lose eight members of H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network each year due to illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world , including those illegal fishermen .
among other things , such activities include sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license documents , imag@@ inary names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigation of suspected ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread bog@@ us lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , for example , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
this is why Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i is designed to help crimin@@ ally operate ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine conservation organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed all over the world by means of the position of each single track@@ able vessel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals but also deter@@ ring them .
ships that used to be f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to face consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board tra@@ w@@ l nets which were forbidden .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries have joined together in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now also fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; With certainty , the aim is to let more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia was able to report its first great triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the road under false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now prohibited .
the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal to prevent illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the topic environment , technology and nutrition .
her articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; re@@ covering the country &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s presi@@ dency .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government had rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by being assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the regulator of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located Bun@@ de@@ o state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute shortage of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the office of current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises in her latest article the context of the government decision :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and the rate of inflation belong to the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was for many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join a mass rally on October 27 , as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday Regional Civil Stri@@ ke and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in many areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently divided images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the guards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter pictures , which tell of confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and ill @-@ abuse .
especially big waves sm@@ ashed the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own testimony .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile an info@@ graphic already makes the round that forms the scale of repression a day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government have questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure - this has been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks &apos;s Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your minist@@ erial exercise !
on the road !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from its point of view , has undertaken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has preferred to make critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches increase more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba .
as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father up to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not see at that time that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department in La Per@@ la in prison from 1976 to 1978 .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ us &apos;s son , a man who over the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him K@@ ent .
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and invited me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended one of the ERP .
don &apos;t worry that she will not take you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian Revolutionary Workers Party .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me that I would become a secret enemy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

the prisoners are tortured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks in which cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - were all possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped up in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big lum@@ ps of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked in and saw a couch that people were tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they mounted the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied there .
they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible for a person to hurt another so much suffering ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound and tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied in hands and feet .
near the entrance , people chew@@ ed quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know this because my father told me at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero beat a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors , the civilian Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , was sentenced to death by the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from the top came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as it called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war loo@@ t is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military characters , which one has to fight against an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... it &apos;s not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who steal the car on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and cried :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a good memory of him .
as I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time when I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle jum@@ per from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I answered no problem , they can lay me a burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to cancel .
&quot; the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now where I am older , I feel repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but what would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear for ?
why do children kid@@ nap us ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been possible to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something remains always .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to show my father arose during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest .
I gave him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rej@@ ecting myself and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian sentim@@ ents &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , show me up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I paid the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally spoke against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 counts : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court had life imprisonment for life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ stly : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was taken ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court judgement is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial was erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people living in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a Kyoto Protocol , where you can renew your driving license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
review of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving license , witnessed a particularly mis@@ sp@@ icious translation last month .
on a sign , the Japanese word has been translated to the &quot; older drivers &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ dos@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; wrong@@ ly - perhaps also with vi@@ cious h@@ ind thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible car drivers . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
review of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto daily newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it be such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the correct English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was replaced later by the appropriate , albeit gramm@@ atically not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , it declared that the mistake was already included in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are truly sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , who are involved in accidents throughout the country , is quite a cause for concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , representing a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors accounted for 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the re@@ porter in particular brought comments to the light in the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently have against older drivers :
the article on the translation error , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So , the translation is not really bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com &apos;s website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are varied .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers . generally speaking , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French to the English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who are learning to learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can nevertheless produce translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is best assessed , is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences developed by machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zzling prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . but by large corporations or by the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , it is possible to expect more careful translations .
the Kyoto city hopefully uses a more resp@@ ectable source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they could not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online transmitter .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online tran@@ smit@@ ters also over@@ took photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups opposing the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was z@@ apped and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet Service Provider are again blocked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
offerings such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access by Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elec@@ oms threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is amazing that this is cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technology through which the DNS servers respond to requests for specific domains .
when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies error or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried out the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned .

T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testimony from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas as victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report of struc@@ turally , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof above the head .
but what is not mentioned , however , is that the children do not have to pay for it countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract you cannot lift up .
this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and , in spite of numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating from her studies Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , as the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ adi@@ ta is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family who has her daughter in the belief that she can complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who absor@@ bs the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the phenomenon has been relatively unknown until now , taking place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent sho@@ cks . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military member Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín with a stick until she suffered le@@ thal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited for labour , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to the school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose up against five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she returned home and had time for learning .
the more she was done with learning , the more leisure she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to go hungry , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read edi@@ t@@ orials from the newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host found someone who listened to while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would like to &quot; learn bad habits . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak to Guar@@ an@@ í back home .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible for them to lose again .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is mo@@ bbing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home to me . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share advertisements for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the summary of the ad turned out once again :
dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with it .
thank you very much , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue of the report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paragu@@ ays ) in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í , and the Spanish In@@ doctr@@ ination were subjected to them , and the system of the Mens@@ ú ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to pay tribute to them and Spanish In@@ doctr@@ ination ) .
social inequality in Paraguay and that show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writing to Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is adopted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up , which is mand@@ ated to give citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register with their correct names and ID numbers on the website to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . it is also not clear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not in a position to guarantee regulation at the level of social media enterprises .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a user name and password from the ministry of telecommunications , &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of that , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ) , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices :
I am very doub@@ t@@ ful of the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control both physically public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who seek permission or not . and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a trial process .
technically , this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose senses the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was intended for those guilty of threatening the &quot; public order , &quot; and &quot; to protest to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal @-@ campaig@@ ner H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find always less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining beast of prey in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and flour@@ ishing of the ecosystem is also dependent on a big predat@@ or .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passionate about another side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to establishing protection zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for North @-@ East Japan , documented the progress that has been reached over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , experiencing both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring coun@@ cill@@ ors Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused whole coastal towns to disappear from the map .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma even experienced a nuclear accident , so that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses alone .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from the local perspective which advances have been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( for those that are for the first time ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed here .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma has 70 percent of the rear light .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of housing supplies ( for the first part ) to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by shelter shel@@ ters ( for example , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) .
after the three @-@ fold disaster almost 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shelter shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36@@ ,000 people living in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate living in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , resi@@ ding after the disaster in housing shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by disaster have opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 % of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have been affected extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 per cent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the nuclear barrier zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off again .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level , as before mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ees . she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how her feeling changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surve@@ yed find that still not enough was done in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
as it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also directed its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were reloc@@ ated to permanent replacement houses .
after 2017 , more than 40,000 residents of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation companies are older than 50 years old . it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games planned for 2020 in Tokyo .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the common ground .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over speech and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . release with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student aged 33 years was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer attacked him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a strike against his head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a head@@ stock . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police published in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests to the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police inspec@@ tor was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ Dj@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs rush to him shortly afterwards .

in the clip below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado sends further attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he was sab@@ ot@@ aged by the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined a gas leak . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has struck him with a head@@ stock .
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber stories and tear gas .
the S &amp; D Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against prot@@ esters .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have tu@@ cked street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window in order to figure out their front pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
O Glob@@ o , on the other hand , fav@@ oured a cover story with a bus set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a specific cause .
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of material damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation course with the police . &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it was two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding made of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and sw@@ ung daily to the factories that are still grinding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene , a soldier &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; veter@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation again , because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene re@@ members exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be obtained , but the promise was not kept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the cr@@ ushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target amounted to 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food Organisation of the United Nations , according to the 2016 report .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
these were officially written documents , which were classified only regarding the parts that would be removed , the recipient &apos;s address and the date .
all of them were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could approve every withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of working .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ tops was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the work places and services that the plants were generating in the communities in which they were .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to remove them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without any prospect of the future , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created whose production does not even serve the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the village where he began working .
nin@@ ety @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand Pes@@ o a month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a bear@@ able person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene is in retirement at 65 years old , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter .

first Nations youngsters use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo uses with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it through hip hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 , to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in Northern Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop will make it possible for the young participants to explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into the mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ni@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section of street in Western Canada where almost two dozen of the most indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes I feel as if nobody ever is interested in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I &apos;m trying to continue my days on Earth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the day when you will hear our cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and also go with our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the comments section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language , Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the crop in sy@@ ll@@ abled ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( for the most part in the country ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what is right on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ to@@ u ( for the name of the dishes , &quot; Plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) are displayed by every dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ k quarter of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turning them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
with Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ to@@ u .
now in special sales : new mobile phones decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were converted into che@@ es@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
we also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing pl@@ ough into the comic .
some Handy stand and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ che@@ ated is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think I will be the only one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand straps made of dried salmon .
more bizarre plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the area of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missed and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches who have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which should give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime does not only fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; ) tells these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs for his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing ourselves again today for the task we have placed ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th , he should be back , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education .
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out , because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ pointing a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the fra@@ gil@@ ity and the leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been acquainted with illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
every day I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them as well .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in statistics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ tim@@ el@@ essness of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months &quot; in the main city district : how a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; it describes how armed criminals were squee@@ zing money out of their business for month , until they destroyed not only the business , but also torn apart their family .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of this never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for making the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a result of violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Ci@@ tiz@@ ens for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosecution numbered 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country &apos;s soul .
few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; project , Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this article and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how about the years after something has emerged ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to per@@ sist .
take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been widely used to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but there are questions about our cra@@ ving for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated for many years . the roads in the region became dangerous path@@ ways full of po@@ thol@@ es which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker lor@@ ry fell victim .
authorities described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a movie theater nearby which was full of people watching the football World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered throughout the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ gur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses drastically reported atro@@ cities to which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and potential magnitude of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely link the image from the DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments .
the image of S@@ ange had also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations , those who escaped could flee blows , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following relate to those who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page fal@@ sely claiming to be the president of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an Being . monks and politicians allegedly participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original article , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source had also wrong@@ ly attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not associated with it the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false cou@@ ches date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , some have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of abuse and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which page they have been published . thus , we want to illustrate the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also linked to each other ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases which can now be completely detected ( on the map in orange ) :

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ ri@@ fy the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are pursued , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government published a report on what it was intended as &quot; intentionally in@@ toxic@@ ated news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings on Myanmar . &quot;
this judgment , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech run and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims are Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often propag@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to contain it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital news page , has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ har@@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later put into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the paper El Pa@@ is attempted to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) .
the image of the DR Congo appeared , marked with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were taken up in no religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly dra@@ fted by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums such as this one were translated into Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be ho@@ ax .
from the embassy in which the image was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dist@@ anced .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Grau ) , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasional file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original issue of 2010 , the image ultimately could possibly have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ estimated in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
with social media , there are dozens of people who un@@ intentionally have a share of the water around a tragedy .
suggests this sen@@ timent of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does it taste the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to the recognition of the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that violent images are des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and taking them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study investigating how violent media work on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used from context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive manner .
however , any examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

a blog named un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. inv@@ alu@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online @-@ list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu , the language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Colle@@ ct your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years .
words in the H@@ uns@@ horn language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of these &quot; conf@@ using &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are very much appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood of floods and earthqu@@ akes in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally occurs at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts across the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the Sri Lanka cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and just under hundred people are missing because of the floods and mud waves .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe places of residence .
rainf@@ all decreased on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas decreased slowly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood conditions .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ag@@ grav@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever , Save the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are being completed for the transportation of emergency supplies for the inhabitants that are flooded in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been willing to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood conditions and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call + 49 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital supplies for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Taxi Call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster centre will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for retri@@ eving assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , will bring people in need of security and provide help for help .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now approaching the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i photo .
use approved . in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust in her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts in me her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we are still calling slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next , we are right for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f , tied of an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has established itself in their imagination .
they had to lim@@ b me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
in our collective imagination , this drawer is so well constructed that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into it , are random@@ ized .
to be mi@@ tig@@ ated
I &apos;m not alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western mind , religion was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these images .
but these images continue to stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ ward them .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that led nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even elect their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings , Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong s@@ nar@@ ling weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and er@@ ron@@ eous that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ethnic Americans .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , all Muslims wear - &quot; from respect to P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I joke , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of emin@@ ent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight far spread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ forged Islamic fin@@ ality machine with back@@ ers , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous view of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who tears up the head@@ scar@@ f of a woman .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only in my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ evening ritual with my daughter , if I kept her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to the protection , which seal the Koran and are called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow .

initiative for narrative art seeks to preserve urban linguistic diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an opportunity to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , is the en@@ umer@@ ation of stories in their original language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ miss@@ able blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been running events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that take diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it often is connected to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers must first translate their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even though the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and representation make it possible for the audience to listen to it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional Burkina Faso story , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this turn , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ak@@ ara tells the story of the rab@@ bits and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ak@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
they have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were completely with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organisers hope to extend it . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling performances .
Puerto Rico demands re @-@ fixing of sovereign debt from the US
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , on 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration ; the march began with the American Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went down to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ uro @-@ examination of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates for re @-@ fixing debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their requirement :
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt will be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , working conditions appropriate remuneration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are pressed and oppressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory integrated in the US - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with no party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , the measures imposed on the outside will be in danger of being rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gil for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for more than a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is held in Berlin , devoted itself to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publisher of books produced by so @-@ called book S@@ prints , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , published last year and is available roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book wants to discuss how to set up movements for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with that .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the list of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , and instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of times of extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on November 12 , 2015 , it was contacted by people who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry - a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ hir &apos;s cultural prototypes were more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of many civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not know at that time that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to eradic@@ ate this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this journey into digital arch@@ e@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spent my whole life in dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ filed book that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when he visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book envelope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your charming eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I forget the prison &apos;s thr@@ ong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
which I wear with passion ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments back ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bas@@ hir &apos;s story is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique : due to corruption @-@ convic@@ ted director after release on previous post
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other defend@@ ants , sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for disper@@ sion of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( some 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice Cam@@ ba@@ za ruled between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , which submitted the motion , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , since the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many people don &apos;t call this action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integr@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to restart the director :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we note is that the firm should also have a disciplinary approach against the infrin@@ gements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company apparently remained silent and did not allow appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; contradictory &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them .
he could keep paying lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za likes to be paid for his silence .
in a disgu@@ ise manner !
Bit@@ on Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn &apos;t have any moral :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I cannot believe that you are rewarded in such a way that insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serving the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served only on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves are part of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el &apos;s prison that Moz@@ ambique will not only be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - inci@@ dentally , proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . he changes tactics but does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was 10 years old and released .
and today the company , in which he res@@ ig@@ ns money , res@@ ides under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Wav@@ eter@@ os@@ exual ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 May 2017

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely distra@@ c@@ ting con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of useful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have talked about the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ace@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ keeper A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; like this :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
but he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ in win H@@ tet is of the opinion that it must reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before it sol@@ ves all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who dissemin@@ ate hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise her nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dissemin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cen@@ sus of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to share his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the mail was not consistent with the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author gave his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and prohibited words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely resolved posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ckery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also fuel violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the ramp@@ ant hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look into context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learn from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should forbi@@ d this practice , so that the age @-@ ready age is now at 18 .
before this change of the marriage , some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ m Mahar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
this happened , not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children being married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Statisti@@ cal Office of the Land confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at abol@@ ishing laws for child@@ birth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the kid@@ nap@@ pers , they should , dam@@ ned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition cared for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the marriage was decided - despite the four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them voted against it .
after having been approved in the Senate beforehand , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws of child marriage were finally am@@ ended .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is minist@@ ering a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion that it took long enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the law of marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who openly talked about how important the adoption of the law is , noted :
the age @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years regardless of the religious affili@@ ation .
the draft to am@@ end the marriage proposal was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members of the Euro MPs voted in favour of the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is legally no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... )
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
yet a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the secretary general of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organization of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action if the law was to be adopted , and he seems to resolve his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wanted , one would approach the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as general , in a way that can only provoke panic and dis@@ grace , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters in front of it , will be ab@@ used by being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage of them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it is a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , even though there are laws which they prohi@@ bit .
hack@@ ers are the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office before national protests at the Russian National Day
screen@@ print of the message posted on Sunday morning on the website of the Public Prosecutor of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l district .
on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ de with the day of Russia - the Russian National Day - the website of the prosec@@ utor was hack@@ ed from the district of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l . hack@@ ers left a wit@@ ty message &quot; ble@@ aching home .

the hack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; the Office of the prosec@@ utor calls on citizens to not follow the provo@@ cation and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;
at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the page - however , it remained in the cache .
it &apos;s # ruth@@ less
on Sunday , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office informed the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally black@@ ed .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series resist the closure .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using revision tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN @-@ pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet law ( # 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirror sites ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on domain names , making it difficult to complete a complete cens@@ orship .
the content is however , despite legal prohibition , available .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was done regardless of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ pages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as employees at Moz@@ illa in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server continues the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the necessity for nature protection
a su@@ h@@ len@@ se rhin@@ o , ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo from Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motives and well @-@ balanced colors .
this motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten up the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes from the tourist village of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leop@@ ard was and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to co @-@ operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know , for he stood face to face to tig@@ ers ,
a tiger cannot be bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he sat down immediately , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for you . &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of ad@@ ders at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accomod@@ ations .
take a look at some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was once again released as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , preserve this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after she spoke to a married family with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer ad@@ missions to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health workers as well as house@@ wives , came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the Camp@@ a@@ ign # K@@ hel@@ vil@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the disclosure of practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected individuals , and leads this club .
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was about women who don &apos;t call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not saying loud the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they have all committed and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is regarded as being invalid , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a century @-@ old tradition in which married women should never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only sat in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing it .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was scar@@ ed and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the red @-@ red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the red @-@ red dot if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip on every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months , for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought of before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to have certain things to say , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes .
since her marriage , some women in the group have only borne sar@@ is .
for most , this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ war @-@ Cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant , they didn &apos;t dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes , morality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round , so that the women could carry them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something changed in the five months since her first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are getting rolling slowly :
so far we have only taken small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - lie at the end of a heavily navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a day of commem@@ oration
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29 this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the French t@@ witter @-@ trend , where many fans share memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al of the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , re@@ marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this has been enough to make the Japanese go through .
the people here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail@@ ing giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day is in Japan .
even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese Kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day is .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll should be represented by John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places that are related to the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
the Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
sometimes the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges may not be whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal enough :
good morning together .
today Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day is .
right today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
and of course some companies also utilize the fan base in the market , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
this is how the day is going to run today .
so , we hope you are there !
this is followed by the h@@ ash@@ tag of the be@@ ards , which are for the first time in order to learn more about the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
men of cross @-@ headed men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that men of smu@@ g@@ gled men in Moz@@ ambique could be the target of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apping persons for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for un@@ believing purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the Malawi border .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed to the use of the organs of Sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
the local super@@ sti@@ tion was given to the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man could contain gold or wealth , declared the BBC &apos;s commission@@ er of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia .
it is the first time that successive attacks on the men of men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of kill@@ ings for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country conducted a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
respect for k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the goal of ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police warned of the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men on account of their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for supposedly un@@ believing rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of blo@@ gger &apos;s poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , THE S@@ ME is ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to go on the road , to demand sex against good grades , and to take school sex against good marks , a country where people would not hurt honest people or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for un@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted , which aim to attain rapid riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humour did not escape .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district of Mor@@ rum@@ ma@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ce , and the police spokesperson on Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are flu@@ ffy :
Moz@@ ambi@@ an authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ ination of people with a lot of people .

a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) has a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arab blo@@ g@@ gers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ hir &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons who were themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but they did not give any further information .
Bas@@ hir &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s work is a pioneer of Open Web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have campaig@@ ned for their release in the past five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the Syrian Network for Human Rights organisation .
countless of those arrested by the regime were subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made only recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threats ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and tells a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spokes@@ man , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway Finn@@ s
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . Norway signed an agreement in June to resume the exports to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as announced in a statement on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; wish him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the AF@@ P news agency on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the US Embassy &apos;s request drew a fur@@ ious reply from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice , on which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u &quot; receives &quot; all the medical support he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Peking of the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had big concerns about whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um contacted China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer tells AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but police always over@@ sees the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not permitted to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues telling :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release per@@ missions for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan Congress of Taiwan
the Council of Continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and to show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ maker Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very concerned in an explanation on June 28 around Li@@ u and stated that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ u well @-@ being .
he spoke of Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosp@@ erous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moving and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the International Bran@@ ch of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s single political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian power of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very clas@@ sy : he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of that , he was inevitably un@@ democratic .
he has , on the other hand , defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re will emerge from author@@ itarian rulers who are preten@@ ding to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , as it is better suited to their power .
in the end , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system were really non @-@ answers given by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam in the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam .
he clo@@ aked relevant questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , if it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points to the critics that one should start reading the whole tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said Singapore was more a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneven , even if we enjoy free and just elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities had been able to gain a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it correctly , and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dra@@ fts the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is both land and city .
as he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet &apos;s Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave significance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who needs to pay back our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one has ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should talk more about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked most of me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan .
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in anger if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we evidently say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada is also considered to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were to be confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the punch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be ze@@ al@@ ous - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , soft but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders out of &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian dual ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can b@@ ump into .
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to pay attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main feature of Canadi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau stepped onto the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zes Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ des the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to dominate the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules his girlfriend does .
although not explicitly political , the music video still refers indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the rule of Jun@@ ta .
take a look at these videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; change of imagination &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons considered by the Jun@@ ta as a critic .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the Army , which monitors online content and prosec@@ utes people who are accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict protection against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Policy ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later , a coup d &quot; é@@ tat occurred .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute to Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already being used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ es@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only slowly re@@ covers in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ch@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Semi@@ ot@@ ors , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together to Soviet pages in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , most of the Russians live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people living here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely increased over a decade .
about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district in 1989 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s which are called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ ska are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and quite rare , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
about fifty people live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
Chr@@ u@@ sche@@ v , which houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the District Administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina hasn &apos;t left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia forever , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither vegetable garden nor house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , let us visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot always do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ asha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently purchased land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ asha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal pit .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she said that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war once were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation turns to an end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy follows him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure un@@ happiness in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shel@@ ters migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez conduc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the path of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ band and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no guide to the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , tells the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you mom@@ my Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy drugs they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ sam from the long journey exhausted feet .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel very comfortable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao is travelling with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that Afri@@ cans already speak of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived previously in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will get in touch with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he said smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez says that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report on the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken immigrants in their small house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula are coming from central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez told me that in Honduras he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown woman , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , travelers can consult their phones calm@@ ly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she fli@@ cks in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ lichen , which she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she briefly presents her to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , mobile users received a cell phone notification in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the announcement of the police , the app was able to identify and persec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online sc@@ ams , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an app with these functions can , of course , be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , the authorities often associate extreme z@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; based on Twitter , which published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers random@@ ly checked out whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the control technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
in addition , &quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( which are in the top of the series ) published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which it emerges that the software can raise the password of a Windows operating system and thus receive un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government departments , authorities and affiliated organisations , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the Cyber@@ security Office &apos;s instructions on the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi , the authorities issued a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the right of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .

everything has gradually dis@@ b@@ anded and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside .
one who gives honour to its name .
one who has set down in a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performers , the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth continues on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were caught during a peaceful protest like weed from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the districts sought , only my own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through silence by scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ tedly .
at such a moment you are aware that you are fre@@ eing the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed them all the way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you scre@@ am Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , or you are brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes looked upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking into my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret the word I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put it in solitary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father like to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed association is still in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I passed the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a course to the individual cells .
I pres@@ ume all the details exactly before I enter the room .
unlike anything else they have assigned me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner and must put me immediately , without waiting for her permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : hitting the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ hand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my voice ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remained .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ eled at the fruits in the garden of my head .
from afar , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams sound every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was unveiled : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played out their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close eye of their world view .
this is not a house , which is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the interro@@ gation chamber and meet in Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and strikes have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me told me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I didn &apos;t do anything to deserve this punishment .
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , why they changed the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked as a refuse collector earlier or if it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while still in the row .
I had lost any sense of feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why he took the next to an electrically charged bar .
electricity was flowing through my whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my half naked body stretched out on the ground was the perfect power conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me as minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fu@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry fear@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always kept me free .
where do they lead me ? !
Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ lam@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips de@@ filed with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house which has been owned by them since 1967 ; the year Israel had accomplished his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ lows ( for example : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposing the conservative majority and questioning its old @-@ fashioned opinion on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world .
with his 25 years of age , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his mind , and he can feel lou@@ dly with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he def@@ ends American foreign policy a special reluct@@ ance .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own living conditions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; while pouring in water dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the gn@@ ats speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ den of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry Jord@@ ani@@ ens announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert announcement .
the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; was canc@@ eled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that question the old @-@ time legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be just plain rhet@@ oric but actually an increasingly clear , cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional gender standards by providing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex marriage .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently tro@@ mp@@ ed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &quot; honour kill@@ ings &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still app@@ alling that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a 1954 anti @-@ crime law , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can &quot; be kept in jail for an in@@ definite time , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure , as well as the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to not shy away from issues that are considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country for a long time .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been interfer@@ ed with politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b is tac@@ kling the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b , &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repeatedly repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and each other is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been heavily cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b presented an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program , Ro@@ ya , to remember later that his comments were torn , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; it was uploaded to You@@ tube without any cuts , but it was only a processed version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ something , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b is wondering : if Abu Nu@@ something , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph later , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service firmly established several former members of the government and members of the Te@@ ach@@ ers Association , argu@@ ing that comment@@ aries in social media have critically commented on the issues related to corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought @-@ out and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and artificial kind of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to rip and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the solid cars , drums and dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we had a great view .
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition about W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ high truck was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

external appearance and body care have rarely been as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youths out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate where street and illegal drug traffi@@ cking is com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 per cent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) have led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unparalleled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts confront each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( other videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and to obtain a training in the hair@@ dresser &apos;s art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the &quot; declaration of love to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel ej@@ ected ?
exactly this question left the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
it was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the sign@@ atory of the peace treaty was regarded as significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but in the case of Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , being exposed to war rhet@@ oric , and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now assimil@@ ate them into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colum@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - lovers of love to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter , which is to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he told us to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
thus the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ ree traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up as they had done before , in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former soldier led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gren@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful ep@@ ist@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone has written something that beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him all and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry for the war too , being sorry to be all the years the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything other than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC was already operating in secret .
for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , its ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice through the state has spread to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help to make society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing those people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote , and realizing that the people I have often seen and hated as monsters , even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , following letter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ers were prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ arming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to take up arms , raise and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now relying on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dre@@ aming of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from experience that nothing is simple . to those of us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are imminent .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ r@@ ors activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not only come into existence overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published which themati@@ zed the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who took suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you &apos;ve brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens learned about the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
for fear of her life she moved to the USA in the end .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer worker in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the rounds through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was in the process of bringing out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ yan : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and ultimately woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to say and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
at the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which cases were you laid - in the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February , I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded returning me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they asked me absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by walking up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad talk , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she laid a sn@@ are around her neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window I got a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them without registering for me , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about the gender balance , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
I still wear some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when we chat with camera , I actually try to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to someone who had spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not shut up a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
with that I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced satisfaction through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there &apos;s not so many .
if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to set up Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould you be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically sub@@ merged in order to become radi@@ cal@@ ised .
OC Media : is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just c@@ ite someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew .
there has been nothing new since then .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports about it until now . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why would you not have allowed these people to shave ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , already before 2003 , I was already well known in the whole of Gros@@ ny when I was still living there - and I had never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately pushed us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ led me even a hair .
in front of the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but above all about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - one could feel how the people in the city began to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , gaz@@ ed at you at once with suspicion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic has worsen@@ ed steadily .
OC Media : what are your activities now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ars , meetings , I esc@@ ort them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t pay for it for a long time .
I have discovered these people myself when I ap@@ plau@@ d refu@@ ges .
I am a Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ away ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who wish to prophes@@ y with foam before the mouth that there are no gay men with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ar@@ ets have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
know , many think about transitions to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m going to be here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all for that - I simply know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 recovered the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability of his family to be able to stand up , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video made on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani Hospital in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on site warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - were hang@@ ed .
their stories shared a thing in common : they were all family pat@@ ters who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , located in the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took over power , and in 1925 put great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the weal@@ thi@@ est and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of ill @-@ treated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k youngsters now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job completed primary school , 55 % finished secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young ancestors .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic mort@@ ars and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi had to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - respond with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be feminist * in general .
for example , women today still earn less money despite equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence against women is a global epide@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination on account of sex still runs across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to talk on skin color , on racism , on black women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other ethnic and proven@@ ance earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are referred to the school more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect myself as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take injusti@@ ces in her thinking that relate to both sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
so@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human being and margin@@ alized in historical terms .
I refuse to join groups that , through cultural appropri@@ ation , absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and sex . some of them will continue to keep silent about the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to dis@@ soci@@ ate myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into being for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of creating myself for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we re@@ conquer ourselves ) says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately called for separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being &apos;s being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution of To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled during the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker in Er@@ bil , Iraq , and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by struc@@ turally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # gra@@ lich@@ en@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena proved to be mi@@ stre@@ ated because of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s ac@@ ten@@ tious ad also took advantage of nothing .
a few days later , the second wife retired .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women make an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence should contact the law enforcement authorities at all .
content 1 Stri@@ pes and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that does not sub@@ ju@@ t Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studio , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various details and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the figures available , however , are al@@ arming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence took place at the District At@@ tor@@ ney General . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the peace courts . also here , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister , Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded due to physical abuse , there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since there is no criminal offen@@ se in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not dimin@@ ish
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that she still did . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she has endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought I would be a victim of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I read it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had insul@@ ted her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen away from Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s case , everything began with mental abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she didn &apos;t get any support .
she brought a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # for@@ you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ linear ) are part of a Twitter campaign supporting Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to declare Fem@@ izi@@ d a stand@@ alone crime @-@ continu@@ ance and to punish severely as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
in this way , the legislative text has been modified in some respects to also win Euro MPs who feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison .
the original draft had fores@@ een most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that must carry the victims of violence at present , if they just want to refund , and would like to obtain a safe accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking has to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts make themselves guilty and contribute to the offen@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; offen@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to refund so long until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence for reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
however , the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman a year after b@@ anning a newspaper continues to assault
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Syrian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ phi@@ de .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , serving a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had deposited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , alongside his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the central bank .
the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is marked by the sever@@ est efforts of the security forces , in particular of domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting and det@@ ain@@ ing human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reporting corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its inc@@ eption in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . this was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to abol@@ ish a judgment in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Board of Directors , was charged by ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces on his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is was arrested .
the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information issued the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ kat took place in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ eri@@ an ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1,000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a security deposit of $ 5,000 in Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set and he was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the arrest of his six @-@ month prison term from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , serving his years of imprisonment .
the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the Court &apos;s decision to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Syrian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was prolonged by three additional months , and the minister once again appe@@ aled the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to allow publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was injured in recent times in Oman .
further violations include , for example , closing the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the Syrian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Syrian authorities to :
1 . immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j ;
2 . to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through promotion of freedom of expression and association and the right to gather peac@@ efully , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , representation takes place with its agreement
medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria are far more serious in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping establish its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Centr@@ al@@ ab@@ ors at the Centre for the Study of Inf@@ ectious Dis@@ eases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doc@@ torate at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am just starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens .
GV : what do you think about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being a do@@ er .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : what &apos;s your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit from this .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
the system that magazines make items accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the United States to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com &apos;s website , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding Sal@@ ad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
patents are not only applied to individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more of such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ ons . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food safety are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mor@@ ton is still cultiv@@ ating salad , but now it takes longer because his work gets more and more difficult due to ever increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s as if in a river there &apos;s a b@@ oul@@ der that I have to p@@ addle down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and tries to use no material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing ever bigger in the United States and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the move for free Open Source software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , shortly called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can undertake to freely use the seeds bred by them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders simply allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately send out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , the recent examples are the merg@@ ers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which are offered in August and September 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to keeping their seeds available freely , as opposed to patent seeds and plant characteristics .

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus becoming increasingly available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about a third of all car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it suitable for plant breeders .
there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown crops such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a Mat@@ ter of Visi@@ bility
plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those , by which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary at present than ever since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to the preservation of genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property affects other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties innov@@ ate . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing the public with more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow crops adapted to changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to facilitate their work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton is bo@@ ther@@ ing itself with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the traits themselves .
the plants themselves form themselves and as breeders , we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the US state of O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they manage most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for salads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders innov@@ ate through the avoid@@ ance of plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years &apos; , he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , making it quite easy in my opinion . &quot;
while the USA seems to be a leader in Open Source cultivation , the concept is now spreading rapidly across the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source seed seed program . &quot; to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre collabor@@ ates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an Open @-@ Source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for Open Source seed seed systems for scheduled start @-@ up next year .
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , publishes a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the Egyptian authorities blocked content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time , the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist met .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , docum@@ enting and docum@@ enting human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains - in spite of this attack and the mo@@ ckery of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities , who should defend the law to pursue this part of the world and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page of M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network because of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web page closures for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt any more .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he used to deal with the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , however is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting on the student protests and recording a video , as the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles primarily revol@@ ve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what it means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi . even though the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , then it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege ; A arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blo@@ gs of blo@@ gs as well as any other website I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to avoid cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the closure of vendors , enabled by circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which they can proceed against these acts before the court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the War ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian army is deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

daily newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bing chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , marine and air de@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and a ten@@ se financial situation in 2017 , the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brazilian Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Global Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even called on the United Nations to intervene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
the editorial &quot; Extra &quot; published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we , as journalists , do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ gade in a country that does not recognize war at all .
in the same video , a journalist wrote that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
in memory , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , has been empha@@ sizing the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , to capture a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . however , for several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria established by the Geneva Convention - the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an in@@ significant point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a week now it is time for the police to mount the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ chard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , chi@@ ef@@ ly by the Assad regime against loy@@ alist troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X peace organization and the research institute , The Syria Institute , are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region East Gh@@ out@@ a , where chemical weapons attack on August 21 , 2013 , was particularly affected by the death of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which led to the lack of food smu@@ g@@ gled through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ ade traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and acade@@ mics will teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how to plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more publicity . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the Human@@ itarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of planting mushrooms , &quot; says Dr. Lei@@ la at Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , September 4 , 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shor@@ tages , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions &quot; before inspec@@ ting their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms to everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break@@ age of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food rem@@ nants ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc . ) for the production of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on October 21 , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of October 15 and 16 . this led to the fact that the government issued a state shower of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 erup@@ tions spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite photos , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017
some pictures shared by Twitter users :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ undry
numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insight into what happened :
the predictable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the League of farmers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , building permits will be questioned in locations with high fire risk .
a wide @-@ reaching proposal on the shape of the forest , which the government had brought in after severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity to happen if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val leaves the same article from P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , are spreading , as in a vi@@ cious circle , to fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Portuguese Civil Defence site on October 15th and 16th , when residents were seeking information or trying to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , it was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires .
even the founder asked for help :

the path from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , which had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
right at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the Haz@@ ara Eth@@ nic Group , was in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say that , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe never again .
in the morning grey the boy should break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

( Joint Com@@ bat Camera Afghanistan ; Technical Serge@@ ant James May ) .
CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been killed by the Taliban and many of the Haz@@ ara were suddenly protected .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af returned to Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar , heavier than he himself , in order to make a living .
back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we do not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy two times a day .
it is true that Italy , on the basis of relatively high twin quot@@ as , is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased personnel . &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submit a request for asylum , which can be applied for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
and so did A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ festy@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ af to soon get rid of these conditions .
after spending several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af stuck all its savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &quot; success story is now the subject of documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( in German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have ar@@ isen , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals go far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail trade and aim back to the country he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development to a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end stands stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey .
citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt enable dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearing of the camp of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the dem@@ ise of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ate &apos;s Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
users would have to register in order to be able to use the social networks within six months of a successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name as well as their ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment or the payment of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of the parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another member of the Euro MP filed a bill to introduce the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the President or a senior official . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposition , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is to be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police officers while demonstrating violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat of the elected President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , just as more than 700 protest@@ ants who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in jail on a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because according to human rights groups , the prison management failed to get the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree that the burden of inter alia is possession of weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iz@@ a freed two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged with reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested by the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
li@@ stens Tunisi@@ an activists to si@@ fted documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , supported a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused officials of am@@ nesty , provided they return all the illeg@@ ally received funds .
the document published on 21 April , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the prime plans to support the legal situation look like .
Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
does China want to force users of social media to present their IDs ?
according to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share messages in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rules , it is stated that the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks . it is not yet clear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat offered to register as an &quot; organis@@ er of the spread of information &quot; in the state government .
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government conduc@@ ts a list of online services that organize the publication of information . the law allows the government to make use of said services for removing content and forcing them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ lys@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has Sper@@ m Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ruled the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia &apos;s administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles stating that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication stated that the site had been locked up because it became &quot; an information source working together with groups to insti@@ gate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to hei@@ gh@@ tened surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time , and to install the Backdoor programs that de@@ code data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has om@@ itted other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation is still ongoing until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
