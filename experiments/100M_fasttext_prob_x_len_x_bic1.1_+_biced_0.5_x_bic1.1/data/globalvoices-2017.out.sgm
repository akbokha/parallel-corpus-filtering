<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely large.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American movie.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who with the help of Julia Roberts uncovered the murderous plot of an oil magnet, who wanted to occupy the top Federal Court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "free after Method Man," "" "" "" "It was as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as it is said so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in favor of him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever attained.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes people from around the world, a deeply believing human being with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "Trump does not agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" "" "" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns playing at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life long for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexities of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied in them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump was making his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presided a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "to categorize people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down on those looking different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (WC): as much as "Whites revolving against all other ethnicities." white and whiplash play on white and whiplash, as the great Van Jones, did exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trump, however, a vast majority of the white America claims this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "roaring the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "have Latinos a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "they cried and their voices became louder." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "" "" "NO" "" "" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concludes with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later, he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is now Trump Land," "" "" "" "said the news." "</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with its musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and banal violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle and bustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguays capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recycled instruments consisting of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers began to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violin, viola, cellos, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in trash The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio had shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Waste Ship) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about 1 billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights against illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated underground fishing in the waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and less inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to dock one of their harbours and refused to grant him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "" "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at his time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia due to pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative that protects criminal practices and protects resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate violation of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail, with the information between individual countries, the actions nowadays happen in real time, with traceability on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There the individual countries, for example, can exchange lists of existing licenses, news of suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to mark ships fishing in prohibited areas - such as those suggesting that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means illegal fishing is not profitable any more." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover, which will lose eight members of HISH-i network each year due to illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world, including those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other things, such activities include sailing under false flag, bogus license documents, imaginary names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted organised control system," "" "" "" "says Long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "but another country could say" "" "" "" "Come to me" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigation of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread bogus licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "" "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, for example, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">This is why Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i is designed to help criminally operate ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine conservation organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed all over the world by means of the position of each single trackable vessel.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities are not only detecting criminals but also deterring them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be fished without a license and hardly had to face consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found on board trawl nets which were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have become a study object." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries have joined together in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now also fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With certainty, the aim is to let more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia was able to report its first great triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship which was on the road under false flag. and not only was the ship on the way without license and were used towing nets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also invaded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong signal to prevent illegal fishing," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world sea.

<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's presidency.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government had rejected the opposition's request for a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by being assembled on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the regulator of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located Bundeo state of Carabobo and at the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation in the country is deteriorating continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans through an acute shortage of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the office of current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but ultimately the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and the rate of inflation belong to the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was for many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together, urged the demonstrators to join a mass rally on October 27, as well as a march to the Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan government seat, on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things as follows:</seg>

<seg id="178">The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own testimony.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile an infographic already makes the round that forms the scale of repression a day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government have questioned the validity of the demand for a ministerial procedure - this has been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take part in the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a grown-up man, Quijano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father up to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not see at that time that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department in La Perla in prison from 1976 to 1978.</seg>

<seg id="222">The acronym ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Argentinian Revolutionary Workers Party.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go to the sports hall again. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>

<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks in which cars, furniture, TV, fridges - were all possible.</seg>

<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped up in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lumps of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="345">The photo was distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Review of original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving license, witnessed a particularly misspicious translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign, the Japanese word has been translated to the "older drivers" (koreidossha), which means "older drivers" wrongly - perhaps also with vicious hind thoughts & # 8212; as "terrible car drivers."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Review of the original photos by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "how could it be such an English translation?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "" "" "said Holmes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The correct English translation was first removed. the term "terrible drivers" was replaced later by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, it declared that the mistake was already included in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are truly sorry that older people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "" "" "" "said the police." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, who are involved in accidents throughout the country, is quite a cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, representing a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors accounted for 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">In this way, their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The reporter in particular brought comments to the light in the article published on Yahoo, which show which prejudices some Japanese apparently have against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on the translation error, among other things, received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "" "" "-" "" "" "" "Is this (" "" "" "" "terrible motorists") about not reality? "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="373">Translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia.</seg>
<seg id="374">Engrish.com's website is a real treasure trove for these bizarre errors in English.</seg>
<seg id="375">Photo by Flickr user Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers. generally speaking, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French to the English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding for translating, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers who are learning to learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can nevertheless produce translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is best assessed, is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences developed by machine translation show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. but by large corporations or by the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, it is possible to expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto city hopefully uses a more respectable source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they could not have access to the Vivoplay online transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also overtook photographs of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups opposing the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was zapped and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of the Venezuelan Internet Service Provider are again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet page.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offerings such as Vivoplay are popular with Internet access by Venezolans, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecoms threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed later that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technology through which the DNS servers respond to requests for specific domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">When a website is blocked by the DNS, the server replies error or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">In VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was suspended on Thursday 6 April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried out the protests in Caracas live, was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV returned to broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans more and more difficult to access multimedia coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="425">This practice, called Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and, in spite of numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating from her studies Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadita - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, as the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated by the Criadita is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family who has her daughter in the belief that she can complete her education, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself" is handed over to another family.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited for labour, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to the school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita in the capital of AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up against five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she returned home and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was done with learning, the more leisure she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to go hungry, but did not get unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings, the landlord Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorials from the newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>

<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register with their correct names and ID numbers on the website to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and circulates in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is not clear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration. it is also not clear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not in a position to guarantee regulation at the level of social media enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a user name and password from the ministry of telecommunications, "to get through the firewall blocking Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of that, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not yet known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research technologist (in German "conducting research technologist") at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights)," said Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I am very doubtful of the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they control both physically public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who seek permission or not. and that means a mad system to monitor people's activities and also to lead them to a trial process.</seg>

<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in whose senses the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the screen," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal-campaigner Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, it is between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find always less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining beast of prey in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and flourishing of the ecosystem is also dependent on a big predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza is passionate about another side of her country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, she has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to establishing protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for North-East Japan, documented the progress that has been reached over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture was a prefecture in Japan's northeast, experiencing both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring councillors Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had caused whole coastal towns to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The prefecture of Fukushima even experienced a nuclear accident, so that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from the local perspective which advances have been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (for those that are for the first time) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed here.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses whereas Fukushima has 70 percent of the rear light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of housing supplies (for the first part) to relocate to final replacement houses after the catastrophe, evacuated by shelter shelters (for example, kasetsu juutaku).</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold disaster almost 80,000 people were forced to live in shelter shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36,000 people living in Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate living in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuation from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuation, residing after the disaster in housing shelters, were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by disaster have opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98% of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have been affected extensively in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 per cent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 per cent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima lie in the nuclear barrier zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far off again.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level, as before misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how her feeling changed vis-Ã -vis the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough was done in catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also directed its attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima Prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were relocated to permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, more than 40,000 residents of Fukushima still live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuation companies are older than 50 years old. it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games planned for 2020 in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the common ground.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at these global links. in our Into the Deep podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student aged 33 years was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer attacked him during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia with a strike against his head. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local picture journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a headstock. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police published in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s that Sampaio was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he suggests to the face of the student Mateus Ferreira in GoiÃ¢nia (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police inspector was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "DesDjalizador," a media activist from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics rush to him shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 Euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in GoiÃ¢nia while he is in hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado sends further attacks against activists in GoiÃ¡s:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father because he was sabotaged by the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group joined a gas leak. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policeman who has struck him with a headstock.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police attacks</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil where brutal police operations against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for speakers, rubber stories and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The S & D Euro MP Flavio Serafini, the Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against protesters.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have tucked street protests by focusing on another, unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window in order to figure out their front pages illustratively with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">O Globo, on the other hand, favoured a cover story with a bus set in fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a specific cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of material damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" gets an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontation course with the police."</seg>

<seg id="627">The community of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill, notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding made of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and swung daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>

<seg id="636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Nene remembers exactly that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be obtained, but the promise was not kept." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The crushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target amounted to 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organisation of the United Nations, according to the 2016 report.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today's day will surely go into history," "" "" "" "these were the first words of Cuban president Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he is most repeated is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially written documents, which were classified only regarding the parts that would be removed, the recipient's address and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve every withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another facility, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of working.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important worktops was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives were created for the work places and services that the plants were generating in the communities in which they were.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth speech of 21 October 2002, the then president looked into the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the community of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to remove them, they also stopped to asphalting the road, this also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without any prospect of the future, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created whose production does not even serve the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Coloma factory, the ruins of the village where he began working.</seg>
<seg id="682">Ninety-nine harvests bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand Peso a month to spend the years in MaÃ±alich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin color, small, with a few teeth and clear voice, is not a bearable person, yet he does not forgive the lies he told him.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have tormented him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene is in retirement at 65 years old, not because it lacks power, but because it is bitter.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it through hip hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014, to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by educators David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in Northern Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will make it possible for the young participants to explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self acceptance" or whatever comes into the mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnibago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section of street in Western Canada where almost two dozen of the most indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the Strophe is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "sometimes I feel as if nobody ever is interested in me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the day when you will hear our cry." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and also go with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what is right on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin santou (for the name of the dishes, "Plastic models of the dishes") are displayed by every dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tok quarter of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is turning them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">With Naver matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin santou.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new mobile phones decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were converted into cheesy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing plough into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some Handy stand and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or Lachscheated is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "" "" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell with laughter?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">"" "" "" "I think I will be the only one." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and hand straps made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">More bizarre plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the area of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missed and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico launched the digital project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with drug trafficking"), which should give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how afraid life changes") tells these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs for his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "" "" "priests:" "" "" "" "as every Sunday we are preparing ourselves again today for the task we have placed ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="772">"" "" "" "where should we get them?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "appointing a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with illness and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I come by newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them as well.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the intimelessness of people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified that they were" "" "" "" "soaked" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months" in the main city district: how a family with threats has been plundered. "it describes how armed criminals were squeezing money out of their business for month, until they destroyed not only the business, but also torn apart their family.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for making the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a result of violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Citizens for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecution numbered 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" project, Animal PolÃ­tico launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>
<seg id="816">When a picture is worth a thousand untrue words</seg>
<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas WikstrÃ¶m (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNMENT: this article and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how about the years after something has emerged? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been widely used to depict tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But there are questions about our craving for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated for many years. the roads in the region became dangerous pathways full of potholes which were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker lorry fell victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Authorities described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses, including a movie theater nearby which was full of people watching the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered throughout the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities to which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "no one was left to count corpses," "" "" "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and potential magnitude of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as evidence for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely link the image from the DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange had also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations, those who escaped could flee blows, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following relate to those who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page falsely claiming to be the president of Myanmar's Than Being. monks and politicians allegedly participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="902">Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an abusive use of the image from the DR Congo, with on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nigerian massacre, and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger to delirify the claims that Rohingya are pursued, since the photos were misused.</seg>
<seg id="903">Myanmar, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="904">The Myanmar government published a report on what it was intended as "intentionally intoxicated news and photos that came to international media, international human rights organisations and governments, in an attempt to create misunderstandings on Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="905">This judgment, which was published exclusively in English, also includes references to fake images of rumors that Hate Speech run and used by extremist groups to demonstrate that Muslims are Buddhists and vice versa (which is often propagated by Burmese nationalists).</seg>

<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to contain it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who had been killed by Boko Haram, published by the AnÃ¡lisis Digital news page, has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it is a "similar dharjihadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was later put into circulation in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the paper El Pais attempted to refute that there were links to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanÄ±yorDÃ¼nyaUyuy" (Nigeria is burning, the world is sleeping).</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo appeared, marked with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9.300 times). but the messages associated with it were taken up in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Chinese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was allegedly drafted by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" over the Nigerian massacre, discussion forums such as this one were translated into Vietnamese and declared it to be hoax.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy in which the image was contained in the DR Congo, the organization of the Claretine Missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos was distanced.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">TinEye also points to other accounts, aggregators and pages in the following countries (on the portfolio in Grau), but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the crawler and occasional file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared clearly after the original issue of 2010, the image ultimately could possibly have a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underestimated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are dozens of people who unintentionally have a share of the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this sentiment of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and does it taste the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to the recognition of the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers and taking them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study investigating how violent media work on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used from context or completely abusive manner.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog named untranslatable (e. g. invaluable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online-list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird chose to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu, the language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Collect your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in the Hunshorn language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page would like to publish more of these "confusing" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the Treasure Languages, which are very much appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1137">Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, is the enumeration of stories in their original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unmissable blog." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been running events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that take diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "" "" "while" "" "" "" "listening to it often is connected to understanding" "" "" "" "these events are" "" "" "" "listening" "" "" "" "instead" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers must first translate their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation make it possible for the audience to listen to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional Burkina Faso story, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this turn, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamakara tells the story of the rabbits and the baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamakara is asked: "how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were completely with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to extend it. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling performances.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for more than a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is held in Berlin, devoted itself to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publisher of books produced by so-called book Sprints, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is available royalty-free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how to set up movements for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with that.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the list of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, and instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of times of extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police" Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on November 12, 2015, it was contacted by people who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry - a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bashir's cultural prototypes were more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of many civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know at that time that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to eradicate this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This journey into digital archeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I spent my whole life in dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a profiled book that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when he visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010, together with four other defendants, sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for dispersion of 54 million Metikal (some 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice Cambaza ruled between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, which submitted the motion, there would be no reason for Cambaza to resume his old post, since the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people don't call this action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrridade PÃºblica (CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to restart the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system, the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what we note is that the firm should also have a disciplinary approach against the infringements." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently remained silent and did not allow appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as "contradictory":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paying lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza likes to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">In a disguise manner!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Biton Viage, young Mozambian and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn't have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I cannot believe that you are rewarded in such a way that insulted the state so massively." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality and serving the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served only on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are part of Samora Machel's prison that Mozambique will not only be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp, incisive and - incidentally, prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously affirmed that "an ambitious person is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>

<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely distracting connotation.</seg>

<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spacebse), 'Kalar OAT' (kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookeeper Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' like this:</seg>

<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question (la) in Burmese - is very similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>

<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who disseminate hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the census of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to share his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the mail was not consistent with the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author gave his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and prohibited words such as "chair" or "peas curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely resolved posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Automatic censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the Burmese text is" "" "" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "" "" "the post says" "" "" "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also fuel violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the rampant hate speech on its Burmese pages." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look into context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learn from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law that should forbid this practice, so that the age-ready age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change of the marriage, some members held Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016 Brother Harryperm Maharaj, a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere since that, age does not determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened, notwithstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Child Rights, the minors as, every man under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children being married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Statistical Office of the Land confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements aimed at abolishing laws for childbirth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about saying the critics of the kidnappers, they should, damned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition cared for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the marriage was decided - despite the four senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having been approved in the Senate beforehand, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws of child marriage were finally amended.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is ministering a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that disguised the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children's marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was of the opinion that it took long enough to finish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law of marriage has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who openly talked about how important the adoption of the law is, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years regardless of the religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft to amend the marriage proposal was approved today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members of the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present during the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all members of the Euro MPs voted in favour of the law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's marriage is legally no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle (...)</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who challenged him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thanks to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Yet a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the secretary general of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most well-known Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take legal action if the law was to be adopted, and he seems to resolve his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wanted, one would approach the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion as general, in a way that can only provoke panic and disgrace, instead of talking about the problem that the state, our daughters in front of it, will be abused by being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in advantage of them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it is a judicial procedure against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm in different gradations, even though there are laws which they prohibit.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers are the prosecutor's office before national protests at the Russian National Day</seg>
<seg id="1383">Screenprint of the message posted on Sunday morning on the website of the Public Prosecutor of Yaroslavl district.</seg>
<seg id="1384">On the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coincide with the day of Russia - the Russian National Day - the website of the prosecutor was hacked from the district of Yaroslavl. hackers left a witty message "bleaching home.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"" "" "" "or we bring you into the jail instead of Dimon." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1386">The hackers posted the YouTube video "He is not a Dimon for you" on the prosecutor's website with the following comment: "the Office of the prosecutor calls on citizens to not follow the provocation and keep away from all non-sanctioned events!"</seg>
<seg id="1387">At 11.15 the message was removed from the page - however, it remained in the cache.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally blacked.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the closure.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using revision tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN-prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet law (# 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirror sites (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on domain names, making it difficult to complete a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is however, despite legal prohibition, available.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was done regardless of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedia .org, a Mirrorpage of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mirrorpages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server continues the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo from Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and well-balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to straighten up the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes from the tourist village of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to co-operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know, for he stood face to face to tigers,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he sat down immediately, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for you." (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of adders at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accomodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again released as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "" "" "instead, they use a pronouns or say" "" "" "" "father of my child." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, preserve this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state Odisha by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after she spoke to a married family with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer admissions to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health workers as well as housewives, came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the Campaign # Khelvilal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the disclosure of practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected individuals, and leads this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was about women who don't call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not saying loud the names of their husbands is a custom that they have all committed and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is regarded as being invalid, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a century-old tradition in which married women should never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only sat in front of herself during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole frustration against him and his family by cursing it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was scared and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "another woman said:" "" "" "" "Rohini meant I should do it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the red-red dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the red-red dot if he did." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we make a trip on every discussion club." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought of before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things, for example like our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to have certain things to say, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Since her marriage, some women in the group have only borne saris.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salwar-Curta, a wide shirt over a pant, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes, morality associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own couple of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round, so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something changed in the five months since her first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are getting rolling slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29 this year, the hashtag was to be found in the French twitter-trend, where many fans share memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered a reversal of the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, remarked the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just about five days the Beatles were in the country, but this has been enough to make the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retailing giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today the Beatles commemorative day is in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today, songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese Karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles kitsch survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today Beatles commemorative day is.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "" "" "I don't know if this" "" "" "" "Winnie the Pooh" "" "" "" "doll should be represented by John Lennon or not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the known places that are related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Matthew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (Memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">Sometimes the pilgrimages may not be whimsical enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today Beatles commemorative day is.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Right today in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same we did last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also utilize the fan base in the market, such as this Ramen Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">I will listen to "Yesterday" today and eat Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya.</seg>
<seg id="1579">This is how the day is going to run today.</seg>

<seg id="1583">The police of ZambÃ©zia warned the population that men of smuggled men in Mozambique could be the target of attacks.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping persons for organ trafficking, probably for unbelieving purposes, worries the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the Malawi border.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed to the use of the organs of Shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The local superstition was given to the local superstition that the head of a man-headed man could contain gold or wealth, declared the BBC's commissioner of ZambÃ©zia.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on the men of men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of killings for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in the South African country conducted a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Respect for kahle men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks, the Mozambican police warned of the latest assassinations of three bald men on account of their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of ZambÃ©zia, for supposedly unbelieving rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of blogger's poor Snaippa, who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃCHTE GERNE EIN Mosambik, THE SME is ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to go on the road, to demand sex against good grades, and to take school sex against good marks, a country where people would not hurt honest people or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the albinos nor bald or bald-headed for unbelieving purposes or "black magic" are hunted, which aim to attain rapid riches.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of the opportunities for macabre humour did not escape.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user, tweetete that both the head of the district of Morrummaa, Pedro Sapce, and the police spokesperson on ZambÃ©zias, InÃ¡cio Dina, both are fluffy:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made only recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years "imprisonment for" Subversion "(state threats) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred Lius case as "an internal matter" and tells a spokesman that he considered it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway Finns</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. Norway signed an agreement in June to resume the exports to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the same time, we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans "wish him to have the opportunity to treat abroad, in so far as he can help him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the AFP news agency on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US Embassy's request drew a furious reply from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that "no country has the right to interfere and to make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>

<seg id="1660">The German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin, hope that Liu "receives" all the medical support he needs, "and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Peking of the Reuters news agency that China had big concerns about whether the fuss about Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum contacted China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer tells AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but police always oversees the room in the hospital and that Liu is not permitted to speak with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues telling:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release permissions for the exercise of these rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Congress of Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Liu on 27 June and to show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese lawmaker Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very concerned in an explanation on June 28 around Liu and stated that many have asked him to pray for Liu well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He spoke of Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moving and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the International Branch of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's single political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian power of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very classy: he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in the face of that, he was inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">He has, on the other hand, defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the subject, the good old lyre will emerge from authoritarian rulers who are pretending to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it is better suited to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system were really non-answers given by Shanmugam in the final week of Shanmugam.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He cloaked relevant questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, if it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points to the critics that one should start reading the whole transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said Singapore was more a "city" than a country, "he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneven, even if we enjoy free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities had been able to gain a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "" "" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "" "" "no country" "" "" "", "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, the leader of a growing generation, making such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I'm not even sure if he really believes it correctly, and is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review drafts the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "" "" "did Mr Shanmugam" "" "" "" "commit a mistake" "" "" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the Cabinet's Cabinet, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of grave significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who needs to pay back our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>

<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop band parodizes Thailand's Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parodes the Junta, which in 2014 seized power and, despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to dominate the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video still refers indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days alone, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the rule of Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program of "change of imagination" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons considered by the Junta as a critic.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the Army, which monitors online content and prosecutes people who are accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict protection against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic Policy).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the martial law was declared in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, a coup d "Ã©tat occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band who imitated the Salut of "The Tribute to Panem," which was already being used by putsch opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society only slowly recovers in East-Abkhazia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-abchasan war has been officially ended, but its scars are still visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchava are located in the hydrocarbons of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups, such as Russians, Greeks, Semiotors, Georgians and Armenians, lived and worked together to Soviet pages in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period there were still more than 10,000 people living here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district was 16,000 people, having barely increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">About 43,000 people lived in this district in 1989.</seg>

<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillband and golden earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom, there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no guide to the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, tells the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mommy Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy drugs they cannot pay, they massage them with a balsam from the long journey exhausted feet.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is travelling with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the track and that Africans already speak of Mrs. RamÃ­rez's Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived previously in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will get in touch with Mrs RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let her go again," he said smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez says that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report on the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>

<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>

<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula are coming from central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that in Honduras he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown woman, a single educator, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, travelers can consult their phones calmly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, mobile users received a cell phone notification in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the announcement it is said that the app" "" "" "" "prevents access to terrorist information." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the announcement of the police, the app was able to identify and persecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online scams, trojans and phishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this app with the filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can, of course, be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the areas of conflict, the authorities often associate extreme zensors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China" based on Twitter, which published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers randomly checked out whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the control technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">In addition, "images from mainland China" (which are in the top of the series) published a Jingwang product description, from which it emerges that the software can raise the password of a Windows operating system and thus receive unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government departments, authorities and affiliated organisations, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the Cybersecurity Office's instructions on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the right of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible violations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2001">They arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to "learn my lesson," as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He demonstrated his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were caught during a peaceful protest like weed from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" cries.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all the districts sought, only my own." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stuffed into the arteries with state safety organisms and their accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night things had calmed down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2008">"" "" "" "I broke through silence by screaming" Allahu Akbar "" "" "" "" several times from my house roof. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resisted by the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Many friends, true friends joined me; we allied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations wholeheartedly.</seg>
<seg id="2013">At such a moment you are aware that you are freeing the mind from the lamp, but it simply doesn't interest you in the slightest.</seg>
<seg id="2014">"" "" "" "I received a call from my father:" "" "" "" "get ready, we meet at the military security building." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you screamed them all the way to the office of the security service out of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan was there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I am now.</seg>

<seg id="2021">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and you really dare look into my eyes and not on the ground!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building.</seg>

<seg id="2032">I passed the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I carry with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a course to the individual cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I presume all the details exactly before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Unlike anything else they have assigned me a larger cell this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have to share it with only one other prisoner and must put me immediately, without waiting for her permission." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">After a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I resorted to an old-tried communication method: hitting the fist against the wall.</seg>

<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently, none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle-aged man, who looks similar to me and is called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In perfect darkness, no distinctive facial features can be seen on me, and doctors don't exist here; we are all just numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "maybe someone whose voice sounds like my voice?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers deny his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Maybe he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me that they would release him if I remained.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would have liked to have a scarecrow to drive out all these crows, which labeled at the fruits in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">From afar, I still hear them screaming "Allahu Akbar."</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the screams sound every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black is the colour of perdition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Greys in person: the Raad (about: "Donner," alluding to the 13th Sure of the Quran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they are here to be interrogated." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2055">Thus the secret was unveiled: to protect the state security from us and prevent us from exposing the traitor and the terrorists in us, they speak in the Alawite dialect - so they played out their denominational blackmail and betrayed the close eye of their world view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house, which is not a land here; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I enter the interrogation chamber and meet in Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me like that.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, in spite of the expressions that derail him: "my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and strikes have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me told me that I had to get used to being punished, even though I didn't do anything to deserve this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">In punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "he calls this affectionate" "" "" "" "confession" "" "" "". "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices at your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough for him, why they changed the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first arrest, I asked myself if the investigator had worked as a refuse collector earlier or if it belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They intertwined four cables intertwined to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them alternated while still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any sense of feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it, which is why he took the next to an electrically charged bar.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity was flowing through my whole body, enough to supply my whole district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half naked body stretched out on the ground was the perfect power conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours, he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed, which happened to me as minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2090">Jordanian rapper Emslamlam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emslam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slips to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips defiled with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house which has been owned by them since 1967; the year Israel had accomplished his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as fellows (for example: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposing the conservative majority and questioning its old-fashioned opinion on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years of age, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his mind, and he can feel loudly with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he defends American foreign policy a special reluctance.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own living conditions," "" "" "" "emphasizes Hdaib." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a man," while pouring in water dissolved NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the gnats speak lukewarm coffee and the squadden of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry Jordaniens announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" was canceled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that question the old-time legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be just plain rhetoric but actually an increasingly clear, crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned to traditional gender standards by providing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex marriage.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently tromped unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of "honour killings" has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still appalling that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 anti-crime law, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence can "be kept in jail for an indefinite time," and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure, as well as the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music also enjoys great popularity and is well-known to not shy away from issues that are considered taboo in his country for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political but admits that he cannot separate his music, full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "politics has been interfered with politics," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "" "" "in a song called" "" "" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "" "" "", "Hdaib is tackling the question of Palestinian identity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib," and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeatedly repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you are free, and each other is it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib presented an interview for the popular Jordanian online program, Roya, to remember later that his comments were torn, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"it was uploaded to Youtube without any cuts, but it was only a processed version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is campaigning openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nusomething, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib is wondering: if Abu Nusomething, who was to work on behalf of the caliph later, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service firmly established several former members of the government and members of the Teachers Association, arguing that commentaries in social media have critically commented on the issues related to corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thought-out and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, cluster munitions, and artificial kind of democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rip and therefore resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the solid cars, drums and dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we had a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition about Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to the Meguro Gayoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearance and body care have rarely been as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youths out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate where street and illegal drug trafficking is commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 per cent of the population of this region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) have led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts confront each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (other videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressers and to obtain a training in the hairdresser's art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district, where we are very proud, because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the "declaration of love to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel ejected?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question left the young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">It was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signatory of the peace treaty was regarded as significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in the case of Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, being exposed to war rhetoric, and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now assimilate them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - lovers of love to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter, which is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He told us to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manicales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo of the Foundation Bogotree traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC have set themselves up as they had done before, in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former soldier led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a sort of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-grenade, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "he replied," "" "" "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "" "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful epistle.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "never before in my life someone has written something that beautiful, so I answer it." "" "" "" "suddenly, tears ran over the cheeks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him all and set me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war too, being sorry to be all the years the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything other than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>

<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC was already operating in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">For this reason, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, its ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice through the state has spread to the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help to make society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "said one of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing those people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote, and realizing that the people I have often seen and hated as monsters, even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the reality in which the country lives, hurts me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "columbianers were prophesied that peace would reign after disarming." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to take up arms, raise and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>

<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from experience that nothing is simple. to those of us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are imminent.</seg>

<seg id="2242">It follows the translation of an article authored by our partner Aida Mirmakhowa and whose first publication was published on the OC Media website.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With horrors activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community there has not only come into existence overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published which thematized the dragging, torture and killing of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who took suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you've brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">She felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens learned about the gender balance of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life she moved to the USA in the end.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer worker in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone I thought would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men in Chechnya that can remove this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the rounds through the whole WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was in the process of bringing out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnyan:" "" "" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you shame?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and ultimately woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to say and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">At the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you laid - in the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded returning me to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked me absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by walking up without the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the entire republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "" "" "we cannot touch you because you are a devout woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she laid a snare around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window I got a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering for me, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "" "" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about the gender balance, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually try to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I spoke to someone who had spent one and a half months in argun." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not shut up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With that I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced satisfaction through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there's not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to set up Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "" "" "say," "" "" "" "Should you be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply gone, but specifically submerged in order to become radicalised.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just cite someone who was detained in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports about it until now. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "why would you not have allowed these people to shave?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, already before 2003, I was already well known in the whole of Grosny when I was still living there - and I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "Russia wanted to bring us to the" "" "" "" "civilisation" "" "" "", "but ultimately pushed us back into the Stone Age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never curled me even a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theater in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but above all about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he who smiled and laughed before, gazed at you at once with suspicion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic has worsened steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what are your activities now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetrears, meetings, I escort them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't pay for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people myself when I applaud refuges.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeaway?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who wish to prophesy with foam before the mouth that there are no gay men with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which, the cabarets have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think about transitions to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry I'm going to be here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all for that - I simply know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 recovered the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability of his family to be able to stand up, so Ahwazi-human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani Hospital in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on site warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - were hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories shared a thing in common: they were all family patters who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, located in the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power, and in 1925 put great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the wealthiest and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of ill-treated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denies the Ahwazi-Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youngsters now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job completed primary school, 55% finished secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic mortars and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi had to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - respond with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be feminist * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money despite equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "violence against women is a global epidemic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination on account of sex still runs across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to talk on skin color, on racism, on black women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord, "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that there is an institutionalised form of racist violence in addition to sexualised violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and provenance earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are referred to the school more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't connect myself as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take injustices in her thinking that relate to both sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human being and marginalized in historical terms.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that, through cultural appropriation, absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap of skin color and sex. some of them will continue to keep silent about the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, still the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to dissociate myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was called into being for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of creating myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: as we reconquer ourselves) says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately called for separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being's being.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by structurally. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# gralichenefraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector told Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another Mrs. Balbuena proved to be mistreated because of mistreatment, Ada BÃ¡ez's actentious ad also took advantage of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife retired.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence should contact the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 Stripes and Statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that does not subjut Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudio, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are various details and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 advertisements for domestic violence took place at the District Attorney General. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the peace courts. also here, 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister, Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated. "for every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "for every woman who is refunded due to physical abuse, there are two women who do not do this," "" "" "" "she declared at the end of 2014." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since there is no criminal offense in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not diminish</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but after that she still did. this should be regretted for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she has endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I never thought I would be a victim of abuse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too subservient because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreatment of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had insulted her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen away from Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity in it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreating her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias's case, everything began with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she didn't get any support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She brought a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not applied." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was debated in the Paraguayan parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # PorEllas (# foryou).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Nonlinear) are part of a Twitter campaign supporting Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to declare Femizid a standalone crime-continuance and to punish severely as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">In this way, the legislative text has been modified in some respects to also win Euro MPs who feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions is banned, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original draft had foreseen most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that must carry the victims of violence at present, if they just want to refund, and would like to obtain a safe accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking has to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "those who are silent in the face of these facts make themselves guilty and contribute to the offenders" "" "" "" "offenders" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to refund so long until maltreatment is no longer considered normal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">However, the submission of the words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is considered a great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this website was closed on the website of the banned newspaper Azamn" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Syrian authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn because of its reporting on corruption in the sulphide.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, serving a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after he had deposited his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "Ã©tat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, alongside his role as the only sultan, he has held the main offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the central bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultans rule is marked by the severest efforts of the security forces, in particular of domestic secrecy, civil liberties, including freedom of the press, restricting and detaining human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in public authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper reporting corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) since its inception in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, chief editor of Azamn, noted that an article entitled "High-ranking parties tie the hands of the judiciary" in the newspaper on 26 July 2016. this was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high-ranking officials in court decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials were accused of having put pressure on the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to abolish a judgment in an inheritance dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, a member of the Board of Directors, was charged by ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces on his arrival.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the deputy editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj, who acted as editor-in-chief after Al-Maamaris was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information issued the order that "the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on any way, including online, from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the trial in Maskat took place in the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned by disruption of public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "undermining the Present of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and the slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3000 omerian rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1,000 rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri a security deposit of $5,000 in Rial (13 000 US dollars) was set and he was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the pronouncement of the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but Al-Haj was sentenced to six months in prison for one year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following the arrest of his six-month prison term from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, serving his years of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also revoked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the Court's decision to allow Azamn to resume, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Syrian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was prolonged by three additional months, and the minister once again appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal to allow publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was injured in recent times in Oman.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further violations include, for example, closing the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and exercising pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continuing closure of Azamn and the detention of journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the Syrian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the Syrian authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. immediately and unconditionally release Yousef Al-Haj;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Azamn so that their journalists can follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. under all circumstances ensure that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work unhindered and without fear of retaliation measures, including judicial chicans.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) is an independent, non-profit and non-governmental organization that supports human rights defenders (including independent journalists, bloggers, lawyers, etc.) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through promotion of freedom of expression and association and the right to gather peacefully, support and provide protection.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, representation takes place with its agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are far more serious in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping establish its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Centralabors at the Centre for the Study of Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am just starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being a doer.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: what's your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, healthcare (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make items accessible only against payment (the so-called Paywall), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more of such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or cartons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food safety are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>

<seg id="2637">So we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries to use no material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing ever bigger in the United States and throughout the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the move for free Open Source software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, shortly called Ossi, US breeders can undertake to freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders simply allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately send out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds, the recent examples are the mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which are offered in August and September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to keeping their seeds available freely, as opposed to patent seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus becoming increasingly available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about a third of all carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it suitable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown crops such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those, by which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary at present than ever since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property affects other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties innovate." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing the public with more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow crops adapted to changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to facilitate their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton is bothering itself with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the traits themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants themselves form themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation of mass herbicides, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "" "" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they manage most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders innovate through the avoidance of plant patents: "it looks like I'm using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years', he says. "with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, making it quite easy in my opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the USA seems to be a leader in Open Source cultivation, the concept is now spreading rapidly across the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources, is a "open source seed seed program." to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre collaborates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "" "" "it also supports them to come to" "" "" "" "Open Source" "" "" "" "seed and sell their own." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol is working on an Open-Source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for Open Source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for Open Source seed seed systems for scheduled start-up next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, publishes a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Luby von Ossi hopes that soon more people will recognize him.</seg>

<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "still, the Egyptian authorities blocked content on the Internet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time, the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist met.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), documenting and documenting human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains - in spite of this attack and the mockery of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities, who should defend the law to pursue this part of the world and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page of Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar-based Al Jazeera network because of alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt any more.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he used to deal with the censorship of the Egyptian government was the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Ziadas blog is given a home, however is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting on the student protests and recording a video, as the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles primarily revolve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi. even though the blogging of blogs may not be significant for the world, then it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege; A arrest, attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blogs of blogs as well as any other website I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to avoid censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the closure of vendors, enabled by circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice suggests the government's intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which they can proceed against these acts before the court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>

<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable and # 8212; at least find the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The editorial "Extra" published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial "This is not normal" in which it announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we, as journalists, do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrigade in a country that does not recognize war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist wrote that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence is a "war."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, to capture a Favela by deploying a massive police station and permanently stationing one unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. however, for several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria established by the Geneva Convention - the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an insignificant point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost bullets."</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and blockades, chiefly by the Assad regime against loyalist troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the PAX peace organization and the research institute, The Syria Institute, are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region East Ghouta, where chemical weapons attack on August 21, 2013, was particularly affected by the death of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which led to the lack of food smuggled through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics will teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how to plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the Humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of planting mushrooms, "says Dr. Leila at Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, September 4, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortages, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started "production of fungal seeds from the regions" before inspecting their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>

<seg id="2833">On October 21, several hundred people protested in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of October 15 and 16. this led to the fact that the government issued a state shower of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 eruptions spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite photos, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral of the League of farmers of Portugal explained the paper PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">According to PedrÃ³gÃ£o, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened as in June, as the streets were closed very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits will be questioned in locations with high fire risk.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A wide-reaching proposal on the shape of the forest, which the government had brought in after severe fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law allowing the construction activity to happen if the applicant had funds for self-defence - that was an open back door, so that everything could be built," JoÃ£o Sorval leaves the same article from PÃºblico newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily inflammable wood, are spreading, as in a vicious circle, to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Portuguese Civil Defence site on October 15th and 16th, when residents were seeking information or trying to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and on this fateful weekend in October, it was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings, which had conquered the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Right at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the Hazara Ethnic Group, was in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say that, she knew she wouldn't see her son for a long time - maybe never again.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning grey the boy should break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been killed by the Taliban and many of the Hazara were suddenly protected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf returned to Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, heavier than he himself, in order to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we do not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy two times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy, on the basis of relatively high twin quotas, is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes," "" "" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unbiased personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submit a request for asylum, which can be applied for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so did Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained lifestyles helped Asharaf to soon get rid of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years working in the construction industry, Asharaf stuck all its savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis "success story is now the subject of documentary" Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy "(in German:" behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy ") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of Afghans have arisen, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's goals go far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail trade and aim back to the country he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "where there is a risk," "" "" "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "" "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "thus, they can sell their harvest surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development to a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end stands stability and prosperity.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocate's Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register in order to be able to use the social networks within six months of a successful law decision on the authority's website, stating their full name as well as their ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months' imprisonment or the payment of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of the parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in May another member of the Euro MP filed a bill to introduce the tougher penalties for the insult of the President or a senior official." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, such a deed would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is to be adopted, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "moreover, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger already for many years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police officers while demonstrating violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup d'Ã©tat of the elected President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, just as more than 700 protestants who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in jail on a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May, because according to human rights groups, the prison management failed to get the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree that the burden of inter alia is possession of weapons, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza freed two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged with reporting on the pro-Morsi sitting blockade at Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested by the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben-Gharbia was mainly interrogated by the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, supported a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accused officials of amnesty, provided they return all the illegally received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April, on the website of Nawaat, sheds light on how the prime plans to support the legal situation look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben-Gharbia refused to mention his sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to present their IDs?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the rules, it is stated that the registration with the full real name will be required." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks. it is not yet clear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat offered to register as an "organiser of the spread of information" in the state government.</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government conducts a list of online services that organize the publication of information. the law allows the government to make use of said services for removing content and forcing them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
