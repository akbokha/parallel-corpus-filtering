that is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him , because as New York Times re@@ porter he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA sent literally blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints for a nuclear bomb to Iran .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been using Ris@@ en and asked him to name his alleged sources .
in this move , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect identity of the people they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked on Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en thus had the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
all of a sudden , although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of separating and ris@@ king , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his telep@@ hon@@ y secret secretly ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit meeting , and even travel links with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
so we put the press on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional approval , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and indeed , they can do so from the moment they come into contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in witness .
today there is communication software , which did not exist yet , as Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the one in the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would be un@@ available from the start .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments all over the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
it is important to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to bring wrong mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental officer who will be aler@@ ting the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street Insider who warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to discover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to disclose &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set this up ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agency laun@@ cher or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for major public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians debate how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and conc@@ eal their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka doll .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter .
probably because up to now there were no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples of connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states you need less information , give less information to start a company than to get a library card .
this kind of transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us that all except one lawyer asked our investig@@ ator how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money to anyone , but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must change the rules to make this sort of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very sad as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that some things have started to change .
over the past few years , we have seen suggestions for more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US la@@ gs behind here .
representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this vast insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that rise and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally finish the in@@ transparency that now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I went on sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I brought about ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sne@@ aking at tips to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with them .
let &apos;s make a time leap , two years later ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate runs out and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk inclusive , a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created such &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ettes so@@ aked completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when visiting .
through the Internet they can invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you count on the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we are striving for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
this makes the most of the guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you please on Twitter to announce that he is a candidate for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced to his name ; if he had told you where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 evaluations who all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they relate to age and place of residence .
we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stands out in common ground .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you cost .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re not getting an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request is not accepted either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimum degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your home ! I make holidays with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the large amount of people who were more than willing to leave these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a requirement that had not previously been covered .
the business is running very well for us .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who did not allow part@@ ys to be celebrated or apartments rav@@ aged .
hosts have allowed guests to stay in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for men have confidence in one another .
when trust works , miracles can arise .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to be lonely , they pass books .
you can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay goes off .
but these relations behind pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I first stum@@ bled over this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is a question of economic commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now simply call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the issue is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , a group of locals would wait to complete a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood that you &apos;ve never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments for the sake of sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of the common part ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of sol@@ itude and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces included in the government ,
were offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were medi@@ ated to people whose children had gone out . In@@ cub@@ ator programs were launched ,
to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . overnight 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host via our platform alone .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar sites to us .
so why did our work really work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us to overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think that amaz@@ ingly ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives me past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this big impact , I wonder why we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the check @-@ up at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
this is how the media portra@@ y people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met Muslims yet : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rot @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , facing the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not only accepted pas@@ sively the faith of my parents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
sometimes the beauty of rhythm makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you and yet loves somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I had a child later , after my marriage , and basically lived the Egyptian @-@ American Dream .
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flying in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock became quickly transformed into ou@@ trage .
why should I do something like this ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; Bom@@ bs Mek@@ ka ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked my country , but in the N@@ u the actions of others transformed me from a citizen into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start building up studies .
I remember how I knew -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on that first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably in@@ filtr@@ ated and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , and struck into the open air .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the rage of people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only seen under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic games .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be some parking uncovered , but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque means to look more tolerant towards people of other faith , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can commit a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop people going to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when you take a look at them , they do not do what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to be a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does ordinary Americans work ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show that when we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian rule system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that if you provide test persons with negative reports about Muslims , they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslim rights .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood against Muslims shot upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to raise the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when assign@@ ing collective guilt , it &apos;s not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or were we safely at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we were silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , drew off my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble way of thinking , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did so with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is shortly before becoming a billi@@ ard business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for industrial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air package delivery entered our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks in front of the audience . a few years ago they started to fly with ropes .
by connecting flight devices , high speed and acceleration can be achieved in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build up self @-@ reli@@ able structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possible in autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it has to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
in contrast to most starter runners , it can float , and has big advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often present basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , one prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , there is a lot happening inside the interior so that it can fly st@@ ably and move anywhere in the room .
however , it does not have an elegant rear @-@ star@@ ters algorithm . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it right when I see all is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed in the evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the bus driver with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this surplus ?
they see that it is still symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in doing so , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be seen in models , the rest will be learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at this .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller will fall off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if restricted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will now demonstrate this by making a half fli@@ ght@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration investigated synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant gal@@ axy , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other faster , so the mass of three suns was transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they gle@@ amed more bri@@ ghtly than all stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was given into space @-@ time @-@ fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange events tempor@@ ally .
it was 1.3 billion years ago that there had just been a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge Laser Det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ ry gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which significantly improved recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detection of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes ro@@ ared through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the par@@ ting of my sick father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a con@@ vul@@ sion in the structure of space and time .
when the wave is over@@ drawn , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and stretched into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really al@@ arming dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and du@@ sting , stretch and dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and wi@@ ped at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . this is why the Lig@@ o staff was ins@@ ane .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a nucle@@ us of a nucle@@ us . that is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
for example , the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob breaks them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the all speak .
to listen to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott is already working very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just about : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s sound &#93; Any@@ one who knows what to listen to , recognizes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 times solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as never before .
on this path we can listen to the all @-@ listen and the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe from them .
the exciting physical processes take place at the core , hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because they are opa@@ que .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own reflection .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things that we hadn &apos;t expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that bring forth black holes , like Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sau@@ erk@@ raut bone for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the sound of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be better than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
have a dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I experim@@ ented with an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of was removing my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , in an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons .
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
from then on , I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think of things , stir up to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I cra@@ ve television . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing television , in a grand style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days of four shows , thus all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programs I have created myself , and not only produced , so still above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that are burning around the world .
do you know who is doing that ?
no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are running a company , a country or a classroom , business or household , take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I &apos;m not just getting around the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it &apos;s true when I say that it doesn &apos;t dream about a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as if I painted on a canvas .
as if you &apos;re wearing a high sound , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the hum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could always go on her .
many people take on when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the tot@@ als -- when I started to work and work and make , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the tot@@ als !
the sum is more than writing .
the tot@@ um is action and activity . the sw@@ amp is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ um is God &apos;s voice in my ear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you cannot strive differently than for size .
the feeling of not being able to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it means genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that I &apos;m not made to fail , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make a clear statement : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more the boundaries , the more work there is , the more things are at the same time , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the sum , the sum , the sum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like this hum@@ ming . I love the bu@@ zz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
revised , over@@ stressed , over@@ done , burned out .
the sum stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single stit@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the hum@@ ming ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t like my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sums didn &apos;t come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was the tot@@ ality and the tot@@ ality I was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you do , you love what you do , a teacher , a mother , a painter , Bill G@@ ates , you just love someone else and that gives one the sums when you know the sums , when you know the sums , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m a Titan and I smoke my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I can do nothing but watch out .
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
the land I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost is coming in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the tot@@ als , but a hum@@ ming .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the tot@@ als , the working sums , the titanium frame , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I complain about broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sums is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the sw@@ amp is the current that comes from the lust for life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums ignore the pressure of history , the tasks to experience , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sums are simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a fixed rule , so that I can rid myself of any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing doesn &apos;t seem to me like working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person is better than being a home ?
well , I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we r@@ attle around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
mostly I feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones do not want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think that they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and speak to my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only 15 minutes , more do not need it .
each can bring 15 minutes to the track , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my ben@@ evol@@ ence , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I &apos;ll be victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes on the track , why not treat yourself in full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not the tot@@ ality , the tot@@ ality is not me ... no more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the tot@@ ality of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s me bu@@ ggy that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who is playing a trip to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire still burns .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I listen to the sums . the land I created , the marathon , I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the sum , the sum , the other , the right sums : the sum of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , bri@@ ghter , naked and new feeling of life is spreading within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m an author . I think of things , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too much work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing ability .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they certainly have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; the electro@@ de is im@@ planted in the brain in order to influence the neur@@ ons &quot; circuits in such a way that neuro@@ logical functions are improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from violent trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often , I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that with skull @-@ brain trauma the brain sw@@ ells and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save lives , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted cells to grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to flour@@ ish .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he looked at it under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they divided themselves slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why stay with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear , however , -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did to Jean @-@ François .
and then highlight color in order to be able to keep track of it in the brain .
in the last step we proc@@ eeded to receive them at the birth place of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ ve these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we have the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we reim@@ ported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and entered exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ ported .
the evidence they show are these small d@@ ots . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor skills division in the motor cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
exactly as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they rec@@ uper@@ ate to some extent , just as with the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before the injury .
it is not as precise and not as fast as possible .
see now when we reim@@ ported the cells : the same monkey , two months after expl@@ ant@@ ation .
I can tell you that we were also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in human beings .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can need that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable ti@@ des .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
without democracy our societies are bri@@ gh@@ tened , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognise it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the mountain of debt ,
but few recognise its twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the high net worth savers and corporations , which are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and contribute to the debts that humanity urgently needs , such as green energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollar sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and boost real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand which , as in a continuous loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , as in a continuous loop , encourages investors to be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
un@@ intentionally causing the circumstances that lead to the killing of the body .
this is my quar@@ rel with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it cons@@ ented to the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting rights in matters of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which in the end was a statute for rulers .
the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and business began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , the economy slowly subsi@@ ded politics and dis@@ ma@@ yed it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in government , and yet not in power because power is emig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my quar@@ rel with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ zed politics that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , economic demand falls , and the managing directors of corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and of the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ assemble the policy and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not matter very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem here is , as long as business and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , just as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to re@@ organize the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it look like to have this Star Tre@@ k @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one place to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and revenue deri@@ ves from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction is made between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , to whom the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy : please just imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of Kosmos no -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re @-@ united politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which they preferred privileged individuals , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage b@@ ins of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world ?
or are we going to sink into a matrix @-@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide jointly .
it is in our hands and we do it more democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in total economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are experiencing it up to now , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is absolutely relevant .
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a Marxist Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfectly confused .
BG : actually , and now we are happy too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you hold from the point of view of the west to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I am allowed to say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill ,
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to present China now , to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century itself , smells enormous after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you return to the first half of the year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not only Greece , but the euro zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the di@@ gest@@ ing denial that a massive destruction line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to den@@ ounce the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to keep alive through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , one might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister who is in office after six months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the financi@@ ers to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did not want to admit they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one from the tro@@ ika that imposed this policy on us stood up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the Eurozone is not out@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 what it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard before , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is Chief Executive Officer at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an idi@@ om hair@@ style and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a squ@@ ad@@ ron , your brain asks : &quot; where is more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , there are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium spread , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch them for free .
and if Amazon puts things out for nothing , do you attack , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts one ski@@ ps over or looks again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many people can &apos;t remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out .
about the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team have watched the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has thus landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says somehow that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we can take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this space will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a discharge is made .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis can prec@@ ede out@@ breaks of flu , the aw@@ ful way -- by data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly no longer worked ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the journal Nature .
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes , data increasingly stream into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very wise people can use lots of data to make serious choices , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I realized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first you disman@@ tle this problem into its individual parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the components back together to hold a resolution .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to break down a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to compose again , even if the information is incomplete and then a good decision to grasp -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first when competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; right here at this moment .
I will fight it with a technical demo later .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with a little more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
