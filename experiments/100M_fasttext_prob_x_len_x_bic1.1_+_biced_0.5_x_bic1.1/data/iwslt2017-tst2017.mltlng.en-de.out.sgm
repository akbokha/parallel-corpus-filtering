<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him, because as New York Times reporter he won the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA sent literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb to Iran.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been using Risen and asked him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect identity of the people they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked on Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen thus had the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of a sudden, although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separating and risking, they could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, kept his telephony secret secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit meeting, and even travel links with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary condemned more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional approval, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can do so from the moment they come into contact, rather than in hindsight, in witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software, which did not exist yet, as Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the one in the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would be unavailable from the start.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments all over the world are developing new espionage technologies that jeopardize us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to bring wrong misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about grievances in the supply of soldiers and to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental officer who will be alerting the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street Insider who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to discover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to disclose [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set this up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agency launcher or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for major public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians debate how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and conceal their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matryoshka doll.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because up to now there were no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples of connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information, give less information to start a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we really shocked us that all except one lawyer asked our investigator how to transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was given money to anyone, but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must change the rules to make this sort of behavior difficult." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very sad as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite well that some things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen suggestions for more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "since then, the EU has gathered in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this vast insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need leaders in the economy that rise and say:" "" "" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of intransparency by law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "together we can finally finish the intransparency that now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I went on sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. after that he would go to the corps of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "" "" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "" "" "I don't know." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to the corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "then I heard say:" "" "" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "" "" "one voice in my head said," "" "" "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I brought about?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "" "" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sneaking at tips to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with them.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate runs out and the rent is increased." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk inclusive, a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created such "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham omelettes soaked completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Through the Internet they can invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you count on the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we are striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This makes the most of the guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who actually has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please on Twitter to announce that he is a candidate for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced to his name; if he had told you where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 evaluations who all say: "he can really hold on very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests left their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they relate to age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's call -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out in common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deep rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you cost.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "if you tell too little, like" "" "" "" "Hi!," "" "" "" "you're not getting an answer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "" "" "you can tell too much, for example:" "" "" "" "I have problems with my mother," "" "" "" "-- the request is not accepted either." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimum degree of openness, such as "Tolle works of art in your home! I make holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the large amount of people who were more than willing to leave these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a requirement that had not previously been covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who did not allow partys to be celebrated or apartments ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stay in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men have confidence in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, miracles can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to be lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay goes off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled over this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a question of economic commerce.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "" "" "but now simply call" "" "" "" "rental industry" "" "" "", "the issue is not fair." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visit, a group of locals would wait to complete a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood that you've never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments for the sake of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of solitude and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces included in the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children had gone out. Incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. overnight 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host via our platform alone.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work really work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives me past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this big impact, I wonder why we can use design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the check-up at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media portray people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met Muslims yet: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrot-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>

<seg id="280">I wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">Sometimes the beauty of rhythm makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever had the feeling that someone perceives you fully understands you and yet loves somehow?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started as all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had a child later, after my marriage, and basically lived the Egyptian-American Dream.</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flying in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock became quickly transformed into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."... "... Jihad..."... "Bombs Mekka!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked my country, but in the Nu the actions of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start building up studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I knew -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "" "" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "" "" "" "Be alert," "" "" "" "Be careful," "" "" "" "Don't be sampled." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably infiltrated and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims, and struck into the open air.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have put the rage of people on the terrorists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only seen under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic games.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking uncovered, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque means to look more tolerant towards people of other faith, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists can commit a brainwashing that causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "" "" "both groups claim their ideology on their" "" "" "" "Holy Book" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "" "" "but when you take a look at them, they do not do what they read in their" "" "" "" "Holy Scriptures" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised to be a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does ordinary Americans work?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show that when we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian rule system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that if you provide test persons with negative reports about Muslims, they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslim rights.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood against Muslims shot upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to raise the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective guilt, it's not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when was such an accomplished young man from my brother?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we were silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, drew off my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a noble way of thinking, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I am perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did so with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is shortly before becoming a billiard business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for industrial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre high tower of 1,500 bricks in front of the audience. a few years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flight devices, high speed and acceleration can be achieved in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up self-reliable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it has to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "external commands are available at the highest level, e.g." "" "" "" "start" "" "" "" "and" land "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starter runners, it can float, and has big advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often present basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, one propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, there is a lot happening inside the interior so that it can fly stably and move anywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have an elegant rear-starters algorithm. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right when I see all is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in sufficiency, this machine is here, the bus driver with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this surplus?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is still symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In doing so, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be seen in models, the rest will be learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller will fall off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we will now demonstrate this by making a half flightless." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigated synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro quadcopters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes circled each other faster, so the mass of three suns was transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they gleamed more brightly than all stars in all galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was given into space-time-fabric itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">It was 1.3 billion years ago that there had just been a multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge Laser Detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser interferometry gravitational-wave-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, which significantly improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detection of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes roared through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">"" "" "" "and the parting of my sick father." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational waves from black holes and their through observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a convulsion in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When the wave is overdrawn, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and stretched into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers in courses of relativity often lead to a really alarming dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "stretch and dusting, stretch and dust." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and wiped at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. this is why the Ligo staff was insane.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of a nucleus of a nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical because you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">This is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now Alice is talking just" "" "</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and Bob breaks them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the all speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott is already working very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just about: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same chirping with an additional key change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender's sound] Anyone who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30 times solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the all-listen and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes take place at the core, hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because they are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the Big Bang is covered by its own reflection.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things that we hadn't expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that bring forth black holes, like Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the sauerkraut bone for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the sound of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be better than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Have a dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I experimented with an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "" "" "for a year I would say" "" "" "" "Yes!" "" "" "" "I was afraid of." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "" "" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "" "" "" "Yes" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of was removing my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of holding speeches, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes," "" "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, in an unexpected way. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all "kittens" for inexplicable reasons.</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "" "" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "" "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">From then on, I swore to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "yes" say to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think of things, stir up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I crave television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days of four shows, thus all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programs I have created myself, and not only produced, so still above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that are burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are running a company, a country or a classroom, business or household, take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I'm not just getting around the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say that it doesn't dream about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you're wearing a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the humming.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could always go on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take on when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the totals -- when I started to work and work and make, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the totals!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totum is action and activity. the swamp is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the hum is God's voice in my ear." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you cannot strive differently than for size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it means genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I only know that I'm not made to fail, and I only know that I love the buzz." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make a clear statement: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more the boundaries, the more work there is, the more things are at the same time, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the sum, the sum, the sum.</seg>
<seg id="637">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I like this humming. I love the buzz." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overstressed, overdone, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mommy is a single stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "" "" "Harper tells people:" "" "" "" "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "" "" "and Emerson says," "" "" "" "No, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the humming ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't like my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">"" "" "" "I was the totality and the totality I was." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "" "" "I know some may think:" "" "" "" "howl, stupid author-Titan." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you do, you love what you do, a teacher, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives one the sums when you know the sums, when you know the sums, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "" "" "and then my" "" "" "" "southern states waitress" "" "" "" "asks me a question." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "I am on the way out, late, and she says," "" "" "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "" "" "she calls no one more" "" "" "" "kittens." "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm a Titan and I smoke my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "" "" "and so she says," "" "" "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "" "" "and I say," "" "" "" "Yes." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "" "" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book" Everybody Poops. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I can do nothing but watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzzing comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the totals, but a humming.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The totals, the working sums, the titanium frame, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I complain about broadcasts and TV-hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The swamp is the current that comes from the lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignore the pressure of history, the tasks to experience, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums are simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a fixed rule, so that I can rid myself of any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing doesn't seem to me like working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person is better than being a home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "" "" "honestly, I call myself" "" "" "" "Titan" "" "" "" "--" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rattle around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">Mostly I feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you consider me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones do not want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think that they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and speak to my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my benevolence, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>

<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track, why not treat yourself in full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low self-healing ability.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have heard of one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." the electrode is implanted in the brain in order to influence the neurons "circuits in such a way that neurological functions are improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from violent tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often, I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that with skull-brain trauma the brain swells and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, it is necessary to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted cells to grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He looked at it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked just like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided themselves slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did to Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then highlight color in order to be able to keep track of it in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we proceeded to receive them at the birth place of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimve these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we have the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and entered exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small dots. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor skills division in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recuperate to some extent, just as with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not as fast as possible.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we reimported the cells: the same monkey, two months after explantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "" "" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "" "" "I know someone who can need that." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable tides.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy our societies are brightened, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "" "" "I call it the" "" "" "" "twin summit paradox." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognise it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognise its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to the high net worth savers and corporations, which are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and contribute to the debts that humanity urgently needs, such as green energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US Dollar sounds like a lot of money, until one compares it with the $5.1 trillion US dollar, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock exchanges and boost real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand which, as in a continuous loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, which, as in a continuous loop, encourages investors to be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causing the circumstances that lead to the killing of the body.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my quarrel with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "" "" "all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and to finance all the technologies," "" "" "" "green" "" "" "" "technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to diminish the significance of Athenian democracy due to these exclusions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it consented to the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voting rights in matters of the state.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Athenian democracy has not lasted long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, today's liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which in the end was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and business began, a relentless struggle between the two, the economy slowly subsided politics and dismayed it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in government, and yet not in power because power is emigrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my quarrel with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, that they end up starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has so far cannized politics that it hurts itself through the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are depreciated, economic demand falls, and the managing directors of corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and of the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must reassemble the policy and economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not matter very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem here is, as long as business and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, just as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reorganize the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and make sure we are democratizing the re-united area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or by something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve human beings, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one place to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenue derives from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction is made between those who belong to the company, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, to whom the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy: please just imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the Cosmos," in units of Kosmos no -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a re-united politics and economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal, in which they preferred privileged individuals, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bins of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to sink into a matrix-like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide jointly.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it more democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in total economic demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are experiencing it up to now, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is absolutely relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a Marxist Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am perfectly confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are happy too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you hold from the point of view of the west to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>

<seg id="992">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays out -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I am allowed to say so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill,</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To present China now, to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century itself, smells enormous after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most of them have never heard before, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is Chief Executive Officer at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "" "" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an idiom hairstyle and describes herself on Twitter as" "" "" "" "movies, TV, technique, tacos." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like Breaking Bad, "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a squadron, your brain asks: "where is more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, there are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to prohibit "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium spread, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is there, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon puts things out for nothing, do you attack, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts one skips over or looks again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "" "" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that many people can't remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team have watched the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four Senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has thus landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit scary because we live in a time where we can take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this space will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the US and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a discharge is made.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that data analysis can precede outbreaks of flu, the awful way -- by data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly no longer worked,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data increasingly stream into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very wise people can use lots of data to make serious choices, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I realized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First you dismantle this problem into its individual parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the components back together to hold a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break down a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to compose again, even if the information is incomplete and then a good decision to grasp -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together again and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices, first when competing for TV ideas, then selecting "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "" "" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely," right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it with a technical demo later.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with a little more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
