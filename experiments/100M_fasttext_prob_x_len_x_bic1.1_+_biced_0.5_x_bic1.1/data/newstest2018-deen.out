Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren Institute , where young people are to meet today .
a pit chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former land of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich is promoting exciting stories .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , who had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a stra@@ pping road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but especially therefore very informative .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet , which you can &apos;t recognize immediately .
in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called elem@@ ental leaves , were incorporated for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying authority between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first surve@@ ying in Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops mar@@ ched with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph further drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying .
the composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comparison &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Early / Today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is most impressive in the example of the state capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was established 21 years after the creation of the map , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Lower sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small plots of land now occupy no more farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is emerging north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the location of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s district , Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the street name &quot; at the &quot; Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Institute . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden managed to lead the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who was brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the purchase of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who occupied an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients was first place , later extended to 500 seats .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the C@@ ret@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ ian prison in Haar@@ 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost is one of the largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts in Germany .
young people meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with training facilities .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in an architectural style to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizens Rights Group published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention when travelling by the state , as a number of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i Law , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities who dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , prompted the group to issue the warning message , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline during the trip and was put into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report of the Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of At@@ tor@@ ney General , showing that black mot@@ orists in the state are expected to be 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to take care allowance or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s Hass@@ berge reporting programme , which ranks the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for migration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing in view of AC@@ L@@ U .
warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently stakeholders have adopted the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn@@ out project is fundamental . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ j@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members of parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given themselves a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U local network met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family court .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommod@@ ates in five apartments holiday palaces .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
region@@ ales only come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the Wei@@ de@@ z@@ oning project as &quot; elementary importance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot manage to make profitable on such steep areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grass@@ land area cares for a lot of work , and much has to be mach@@ ined with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ iser , even if he did not conduct organic operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ ching project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers should be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and wor@@ rying about how to continue their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critici@@ zed for funding
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced .
the area of open @-@ min@@ de@@ dness area amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ warded for at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leaders , a quarter carried the community of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers had to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ women it &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also noted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regional Cour@@ land Poli@@ cies ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg will enable state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art funding of pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
furthermore , the area to be enclosed must not be in@@ accessible ( incl@@ ination over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
the motion of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence of almost 16 kilometres , is currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ z Du@@ de@@ z@@ aune project in 2018 .
the total cost of ownership is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 1,000 euros .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals to reduce the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller cannot handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ters would have ret@@ ched him if he had done it .
but he attacked the meaning , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , which was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your ease , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who asp@@ ire to breathe freely , and the poor rub@@ b@@ ish of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tru@@ mp USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes on .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh encountered somewhat unusual here .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ fic journeys on the decks of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their statue is speaking to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to recognise .
her torch shall not enligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is her only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship leader will make a huge contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flip - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h had naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner , who will compete in the fifth world championship at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which was to be observed after a great season , which included victory at British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the captain &apos;s captain says she is &quot; extremely proud &quot; of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows just how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics about Facebook : don &apos;t mess around a public office if you cannot tolerate the Units of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers hit him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he f@@ ain@@ ted with criticism , for sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary hot head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and de@@ code his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
that is why the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum that is called officially , and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan Spe@@ aker &apos;s spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people that vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a pastor , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not professional .
the pastor rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people are taking a position on the same subject , they will be dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the governor &apos;s employees referred to as &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; would probably call &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused by Twitter users that have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dges James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port@@ tos had a similar effect to the internet .
the number of newspapers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck him .
and even then , Washington had an anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ iz@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zing his position on the Am@@ ity treaty , trade and shipping with Britain overwhel@@ med his position , according to historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former European No@@ .1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort during the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led alongside Arch@@ er@@ field Links to En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he established this place .
he is an avi@@ d advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending champi@@ ons for the first time even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open as she was taken out of the program in the year after winning her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on homeland floor .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ en@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
this is the result of scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are somewhat at the same time , &quot; says the manager of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic that hin@@ ders construction work is a big problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s construction company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers before red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Co@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water from our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and Death in the Indones@@ ian Gold Country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ance in the troubled ind@@ ones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby mar@@ sh .
a bucket in a can@@ opy room serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , there were no fields assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around after 5@@ pm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by public lifting in front of the occupying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitors from it .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea as part of the eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car drive with the rented car .
there is no public transportation .
the city , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and corrugated roofs , transformed by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her pale rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s golden land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles away from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a province province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port was mined worth 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Papua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos; tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Will Trade Every@@ thing &quot; is in a report from the year 2016 Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year include , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric stops are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have reinforced , because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim business migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ts cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who moved to the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua - Mama Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of Indonesia , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised during his election campaign to address the ine@@ qualities and bre@@ aches of law in Papua .
the former Zimmer@@ mann assured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ov@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; he says .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers viol@@ ated their tone and returned later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children assembled at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - im@@ itating in the circle and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his color@@ fully painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ an , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it won &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , security minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said that he would set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries oc@@ cured long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ ern and beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to engaging in these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; who called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 said 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were already included in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not stop .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police shot villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company that refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the office of the company .
the police said that villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , thus the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers to be held accoun@@ table and to withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the Free Papua movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army who claims to defend the rights of the Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : mainly Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosp@@ erous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Tribal Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , international media coverage restrictions remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported to Papua New Guinea because of lack of coordination with related institutions , although rare permits were given to them for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most un@@ quiet provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ying and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the PM .
the spokes@@ man for the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s alle@@ gations and said to journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights @-@ Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also wants to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai pe@@ at , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties caused a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the dead body of a victim was buried in a terrain just across from the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swept through the high @-@ rise in only two years , which is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ ams of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who called his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units destroyed the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and ch@@ illed the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said that it is working on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 concluded that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation , came .
in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his large Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two profit sets , thin @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ set classics are preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to ensure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
it was not until the vote that after many obj@@ ections , the proposal had come before the proposal to finish the final at a neutral place .
new from 2018 is only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists will be the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup next year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training courses etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey among aviation passengers found that more than 20 percent aware or un@@ consciously prohibited items smu@@ g@@ gled past the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that hit the aircraft while they accidentally wore forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered late that they had mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out with more than 1,000 people - operated by a Jet Charter Service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
from the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were millenni@@ als compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common objects that were pur@@ pos@@ ely passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent stated to have know@@ ingly borne items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male surve@@ yed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said that travelers were asked all over the country to find out how many accidentally brought smu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security and how many had done it deliberately .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which fluids they may take with or how much of it .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
electric thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of reservations for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has until now under@@ mined that a part of the customers had already with@@ drew their non @-@ binding reservation .
alongside the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed a different , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number when the recent quarterly balance is announced : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often adverti@@ sed more than 500@@ ,000 orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition has just begun .
Mus@@ k now ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3.000 have been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations were made , in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models should be taken together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to mus@@ k , 1,@@ 800 reservations are currently available .
those who order today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new production lines tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if there are too much delays , then the obligation of reservations for Tes@@ la could become a problem .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from getting away in flocks .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res because of dela@@ ying the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the environmental protection authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state &apos;s environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline exp@@ iring on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations aimed at the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for P@@ ru@@ itts &apos;s regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often has not observed the deadlines for execution and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority which gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that , at some point , P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid politics and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intend to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York concluded in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ ff &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubil@@ ee of the Church , on Sunday , 16th July , at 4 : 30 p.m. , a Ser@@ en@@ ade was invited to the old cemetery grounds in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16th July .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ eage their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische primitive documents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the Berg with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Hill of Tum@@ linger , besides the former parish church , there was also a splendid farm belonging to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lings , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the magnificent settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps dating back to the year 1600 are based on these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a master who built a church , furnished it with a priest , still remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
it was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ys of the two are torn apart at Christmas 16@@ 73 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later it had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ lows were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from audi@@ tors .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half of it r@@ ushed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the &quot; Schaff@@ y Rent@@ als &quot; as success@@ ors of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant .
as organisers , the friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ lin on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
at the end of the seren@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view across meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers reveal the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ul@@ ls and hearing @-@ wel@@ ders .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ ois feel particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini affir@@ ms .
association wants to check the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council of the Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called upon by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes dis@@ soci@@ ation of wind power utilization for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; rec@@ uper@@ ation &quot; of the landscape .
although the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette few days before , it was decided that the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve it because of a failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirement , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the City Council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government still stands out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relevant letters have been received in the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to examine the matter again .
they probably do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped .
in view of ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in content with the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city particip@@ ates indirectly , had concluded a lease agreement with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ se@@ ater households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , the City Council gave its green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a shar@@ ehol@@ ding in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded in death .
two more people were injured easily .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and traders plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the Business Association and the City Council want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract residents to shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to which offers their own city holds away from the usual supermarket goods .
accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the downtown business will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action aims not only on residents of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which refer to the action @-@ weekend , are Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the trade association and the city enter another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive Centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; active day &quot; as well as the well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all the traders and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened or opened again .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre at shopping from sight .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the inner city - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs .
to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly wi@@ ped out , King had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , Germany , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time , will participate in five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mm@@ er@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action , led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners , makes it clear that every citizen can influence his immediate surroundings with his buying behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tru@@ mp translated by phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp ordered a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr Turn@@ bull said that trading for the United States was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activ@@ ist activ@@ ist rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the passengers were in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger seat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luckily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a post@@ p@@ one .
but when a loop around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost all of the audience cast a very real si@@ gh .
since 2005 citizens have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been ly@@ n@@ ched from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of mur@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see it in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of post@@ production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of State Georgia and a life @-@ long civil law@@ gi@@ ver .
for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician places a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ ching on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused of .
although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , citizens are saying that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the Black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI of the black@@ leg@@ ger Roger Mal@@ com a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or has happened in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they approached the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in mur@@ ders , evi@@ den@@ ced evidence and distorted the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is illustr@@ ative , gri@@ pping and well @-@ founded in a kind of profound racism , many of whom want to believe that in America they no longer exist .
it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
calf Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of chief C@@ lan@@ member for many years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors rehear@@ sed Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cries out and push@@ es him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he , he disappeared from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs best .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but one of the other black performers were swe@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly as the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship will replace the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed in mour@@ ning , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays with g@@ listening praise to &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice is breaking at every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the breast@@ feeding bodies and whis@@ per to each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bling a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope away and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ hid embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance breaks through with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta talks about the post@@ p@@ one with a black pair they &apos;ve just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky strug@@ gled to find words which feelings the performance left behind .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these horrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do it because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is holding his yard at his table , eating and remin@@ ding the citizen &apos;s rights .
he said he had started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is inspiring in a way because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , whoever does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a multi @-@ coloured fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) also shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner along with the Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhine @-@ mort@@ als pose as a rock energy , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stamped oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which is drawn by his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine hum@@ idi@@ fiers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise beautifully as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; .
according to K@@ ESS , she seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , breaks a cor@@ pse in the trunk of Hollywood and gives the Kra@@ pan@@ o Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heavy @-@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he smil@@ ed Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) has to believe it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with thunder@@ ous applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly and form@@ ly bow their hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated stor@@ my .
great applause exists for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat in casual casual wear .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awaited .
in 2013 he had had to pass a fi@@ ddle of pipe concert , five years later , there was great rejo@@ icing in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were going down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced over this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown into an understanding of the point of view .
I draw a positive summary .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually at the furniture fair in St@@ einf@@ urt , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the Fur@@ niture Bridge .
and I also worked in the open whole day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , i.e. a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does it come about ?
amount : I did Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
for me , I realized that it &apos;s wrong for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself , what are you doing .
make a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual studies , probably do a social worker education in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always depends where you are doing your FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs off .
in a different way than in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ ati@@ ks .
there are always other people who have a different story behind each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee , if a young man who was taken out of the family - must always be individually prepared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , much kindness .
there are also some negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son sp@@ ends 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and shor@@ ten their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing .
the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , will in addition to its previous restructuring , with which 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May in a third cost @-@ cutting program , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast step towards digital learning .
the company , which had sold his stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann in the past month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after the first half of the year posted an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , an Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , shared a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ approved local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .

in a statement by NATO it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby district of B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .

EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ king Ru@@ le to C@@ lay
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to push ahead with the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it is the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and because we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country to specify where cuts must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has attempted to drive back a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda aimed at boo@@ sting economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the Democrats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma .
common room wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two opposing voices , the joint council of flu@@ orn @-@ win@@ tw@@ ining decided to establish a common room in the future residential community .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the land is signed , says mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will take a long time until the area of the congregation has so far belonged to the church community , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ med from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room for this purpose .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a space of 70 square metres for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are ho@@ vering such a common room not as a meeting place for residents of sen@@ i@@ oren@@ mentally friendly living , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget , will be made by funding opportunities already last autumn .
the building is located in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the setting up of a common room would be , as reported , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ j@@ ades , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposal envis@@ ages in order to signal the investor that in this respect it is not intended to throw a bil@@ l@@ lover between the legs , the statement that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding structure - as well as pul@@ pit roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - are possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition .
if it helps : it is unanim@@ ous that it happens to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which you can &apos;t move so well , but now you lean back in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I am so hard doing that . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger does not speak for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a concealed subsi@@ dy to any asset or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface you don &apos;t give a subsi@@ dy , but get a real , in doubt market@@ able counter@@ value , is the counter @-@ talk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s proposal to split the proposed resolution appropriately finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the case with two opposing voices in the original program Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ arises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we touch the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cyclists gets thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old landing field had been on the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer Road from the direction of Hil@@ den on 12 : 20 o &apos;clock .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the bush Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a passenger car driver in the same direction granted priority to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he obviously did not respect the traffic .
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching carriage .
FC Bayern Munich has to do without the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first time in the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
the staff members of the German football record champion Bavaria Munich are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official performance of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer heav@@ y@@ weights has captiv@@ ated the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
to hike in the resin of star to star
the nation &apos;s first &quot; Star@@ trail &quot; is to emerge in the resin .
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ etary Road in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ Path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approach to the need for information of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athletic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be added to the Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the star@@ path will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation the star is a selected star and when it is best to be seen .
since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany in the village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen there is something similar to the planned Star@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Road since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ den Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( village Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to to the d@@ warf planet at the end point - are positioned precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth is shr@@ inking to a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun &apos;s exactly 75 meter distance measuring 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix@@ star would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the failed World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What are you doing , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt to Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ ma noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went up for Bron@@ x &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he must move on weight @-@ weights &#91; 135 pound &#93; and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
boxing needs this fight . &quot;
Kli@@ ma asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and subsequently expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko said in the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to do the co @-@ out . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stroke strength , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum going on for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighter , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after tyre rup@@ ture
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
following initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle after a tyre bur@@ sting at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in front of the market wide end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ turned and then stayed on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first provision of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was blocked north@@ ward for about an hour , then traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; the supply chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig after 2 : 2 that the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e scored points .
with the first match of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result also , would not have been the two opponents of the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to pay even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the supply chain is to be further optimized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fool will not want to catch a fool after a breach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no one stands next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the three @-@ chain preparations than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just finished in the three @-@ position chain at Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t afford to make so many mistakes in building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good start to the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about that .
&quot; I judged the start in the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who did not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el und Hoffmann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the players from Au@@ e could possibly be a bit fres@@ her , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascension favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 % where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland are a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we sweep them away only because we are entitled to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine matches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as head coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ old assessment tests published
recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Agency for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
they should make the assessment of the age more precisely during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied about his age .
in May , the agency published 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the person is 18 years old or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det searched out the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
one skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say that we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assessing the child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are proceeding well .
on Wednesday , a heavy @-@ duty concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Government of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three renovation needed bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Easy is sure that the schedule will be kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come to the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively , 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side got a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is an edge mounting , which is also used as operating road .
a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge should be used on Friday in the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented brid@@ ging caps .
special finger tip sensitivity has required the laying of lines by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , first fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the her@@ on in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light .
the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed for the construction of the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance .
the cost of the three bridge denom@@ inations amounts to 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colourful protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the circle day ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the vote &quot; great campaign clock . &quot;
and known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
but those who have been on the spot for hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forums A World and one of the organizers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; original German potato salad , &quot; which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes was reported by the Af@@ D volcano Ei@@ fel , he tried to get such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf lived in constant demand in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking places due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also the case : at about 8@@ pm there will be a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall , waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to speak .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can put off - no special incidents .
the Tru@@ mp@@ et meets Tru@@ mp@@ et
there is a re@@ hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the row of Has@@ lach mon@@ astic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ians &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and lau@@ re@@ ates of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the famous Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating complete artwork .
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed with huge success in Freiburg on this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ lach monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I would like to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette performer covers the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten suggested that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; suffered especially among them , but in the school days , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some consider me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announced that he changes the party
the West Virginia Gover@@ nor , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Justice added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally before .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the National Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working to make our country magnificent again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , solitary message , &quot; said the leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were gra@@ bbed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gold and silver med@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself that it has experienced some quite hot days and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; he said in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council .
funeral act for soldiers cut off in Mali
at a funeral service in the North Hes@@ sian village of Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers arrived at a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the still unclear cause of the fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice which they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died a week ago in Mali in West Africa .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the St. Peter &apos;s Cathedral .
at noon , only the members of the church took leave .
afterwards , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens &apos;s premi@@ er Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ning fi@@ sts laid down roses , the car@@ ers stood in arm in arm on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the surrounding soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the Tiger &quot; Tiger &quot; in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
even Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belonged , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn down the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt about the UN Mission in Mali : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deployment is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country that we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to continue in the communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also lays down the title of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
it is still unclear where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for over the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand with the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was swa@@ ying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ els instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation here to be the brand of soci@@ alistic intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s prime minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday he spoke for the resolution of Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising resignation of a Gre@@ ens MPs from their country @-@ wing faction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Land@@ tag election , the Red @-@ Green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ ests founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U faction leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats .
up to now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on January 14th next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Stephan Wei@@ l , however , it is essential that the Land@@ tag finally decides its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the Constitution also provides the possibility that the Land@@ tag draws confidence from the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be insp@@ ected legally properly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the back@@ sliding members to return their land tag .
&quot; we do , of course , assume that it res@@ ig@@ ns its state mandate , which it has received through the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; said the Chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the background that there were no content differences , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of El@@ ke T@@ ests from Lower Saxony to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
the politi@@ cian is &quot; in her latest vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to make it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s CD@@ U @-@ president Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused the v@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the outcome of the 2013 Land@@ tag with a personal career .
at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens in front of the SPD , but in the Land@@ tag they had a very thin majority of one voice .
interview - How do we protect ourselves against gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) talks with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) address and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will present the latest information on the affected egg bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if , after all , what we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house has switched off immediately and is in close contact with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of Germany .
all information and risk evaluation are available for the consumer .
trade has the same effect as manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual sugar level is exceeded by 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ polluted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , the factories are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , production operations are not found to be an immediate fault .
on the contrary , they must expect economic damage due to the mis@@ use of illegal practices by service providers .
as always there is too little control in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is there only a lack of staff or a conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent .
this is precisely why a consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys in cases where criminal off@@ ences are available are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm with food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and viable food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are entitled to law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of the fake means , manufacturers , distributors and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ safe animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
this has to be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the facts are solved quickly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expenditure on European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules launched by UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G must prove that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign him and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich family of Q@@ at@@ ari .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but must object to legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the liabilities of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch initially used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , the UEF@@ A successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are away from excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , facing The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sales revenues for the next five years amounted to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , has hit the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is searching for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cataly@@ st company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered a legitimate revenue .
that was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor@@ ship value of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come from payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup am@@ bass@@ adors will be am@@ bass@@ adors to find such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were un@@ authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accounts for the last fiscal year must be published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s leaving by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state which finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country owns a club , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has been made for Swiss .
now the sweet collaboration is at the end of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report from Friday &apos;s newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; on request from the news agency S@@ DA .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products are checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white pre @-@ packaged food panels to 14 grams distribute per year the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is always the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a chocolate producer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how many applicants there are with the new tender will not reveal the Swiss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will try to renew the contract in spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter .
the opportunity to place the logo took Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline is co@@ operating with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights customers of the First Class are p@@ am@@ pered by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y is also distributed on the short circuit , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of the story is nostal@@ gic at the same time because of the glorious days of characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ er @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( when the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter took the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for an appealing jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by getting into the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors are playing tight children , who are grown up - they still managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes beyond the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
at one point , a character is rum@@ ma@@ ging through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy vi@@ cious plot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good general impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as usual , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is particularly fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s mut@@ ations of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that this fran@@ chise could fuel up like a repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the bonds of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West ring combat icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to look at ( the police sp@@ ends time watching chess on TV , like Americans perhaps doing it with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de the voice out . &quot;
but &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes , it is drawn , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; who was edited down to a smaller length could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef regularly visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years , and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
two persons were arrested at the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
as early as summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the course of the investigations , mainly Italian nationals combined with reference to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the account of the gang .
manner lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreigners &quot; register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the ali@@ ens central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to severe mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the information , 10 million people are registered with foreign nationality , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data have not been adequately maintained , the quality of data in parts has not been good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of a sufficient number of people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel at all .
however , such false orders led &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with adequate &quot; means , according to this , in analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they have returned from there .
it emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot;
according to the paper , it is said that BA@@ MF is carrying out such methods &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU State is responsible for refugees to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant trav@@ eller travels to another EU country , this state can return it to the entry visa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy gave guarantees to the reception and accommodation of family guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dublin Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening for the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system against un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a danger of child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
in a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available for other people .
at least of the twelve people who were awarded on Friday .
above all , Jürgen Gre@@ ys , who with his 100 donations now shares 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the congregation acknowled@@ ges multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is designed for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to foreigners , yet un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; under@@ lined the mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the county leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents .
three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K county council leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre &apos;s cab has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
even before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a converted to the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many farewell Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their juice .
the Bank of England will hold the interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving for an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs would have to rise more than anticipated in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth business package that was issued one year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time to finance the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks as of the coming February , although it has been said that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , since the pressure on the real income of households is still bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot;
in the interest rates it was repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than the markets would expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank however stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progres@@ sively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forecast for growth below for this and next year will rise by 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to this news vis @-@ à @-@ vis the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on a rate increase and the GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor levels of sal@@ aries , as sharpen@@ ing becomes even worse before it becomes better .
she added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent &quot; income from being &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; clear &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts .
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until it will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this has been expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
the Bank said that the over@@ write in proportion to its target of 2 % is &quot; entirely &quot; attributable to the weak pound .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ ea Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent down@@ turn of Swa@@ p rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking lou@@ dly for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those who run the existing deals and fin@@ alize the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ formative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by healthcare through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England head Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to make registration of people possible , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in cases of infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified which agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , aimed specifically on vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now as the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people infected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow Minister of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how trans@@ formative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this effort brings us one step closer to the understanding of the advantages of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to bringing a step closer to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it &apos;s a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was my request , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , she commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed over each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper beam window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it look longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
mirr@@ ored units are available at the entrance for all the tops and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan explains from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important so that when you slide the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional attachment in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can turn into something completely ast@@ ounding by a good design and an increased square meter number .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation due to one of the largest real estate @-@ empire Vict@@ ori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - owns about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
this means that Col@@ in &apos;s property is worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded it .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first den@@ im of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi died in 2012 hoping to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of its financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very reluct@@ ant , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 , Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can &apos;t really say much , &quot; because the case was before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current stri@@ fe , &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; still hopes for a solution . &quot;
this hope seemed to be over on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tru@@ mp of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others tried it and failed .
maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp White House that he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the president .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media diet .
President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relation to television extends decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was angry for unfair reporting it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were convincing , &quot; said the former campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep the Tru@@ mp Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaigns , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp Twitter was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tru@@ mp T@@ we@@ ets would not have included more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
if his employees managed to keep it away from him several times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has been able to consistently prevent Tru@@ mp controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp materials that may promote their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to provide doub@@ t@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp is able to react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the president vi@@ gil@@ ant a printed copy of an article from Got@@ tar@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter because of har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence , or that he vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and vo@@ iced it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tru@@ mp receives . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
the most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police across Europe will send mail to dangerous criminals this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals naturally are not known , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action following the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many refugees hide themselves at destinations , called Euro@@ pol .
you have put together 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ invites , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on references to the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a rift and return to the &apos; million@@ aire &apos; row
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travellers on the foot of the war , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ ors .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they had been thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug by the council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have urged the council of Soli@@ hull to say that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
the Council has to be forced into action by Sch@@ am as he was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last night , more than yesterday , probably even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long brief@@ ings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ paved camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
that is good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the former ambience operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in the face of dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building offered the district council as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald was defending the hotel location and already spoke of serious interest in the house at that time .
he was to be right .
the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els group with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been building @-@ sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what an extensive renovation work is done .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
one does not want to position itself on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable at the hotel .
he already had talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourist director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s performances are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
when asked about the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to decide exactly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the external installations are also brought to front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : US Special Agent sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee received the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to persons entrusted to the cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper regarded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reports that there are already initial proposals for the committee in connection with a meeting between the Tru@@ mp of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time actively interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between the Tru@@ mp election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , there are to be several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans during the election campaign .
as a result , Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more Tru@@ mps &apos;s private and business environment .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special agent Tru@@ mp personally moved to the center and searched for the accus@@ ation whether the President could have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the Prosec@@ ution .
mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for the interro@@ gation under oath .
according to the CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. there were also Tru@@ mp advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam President Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction show that Mu@@ eller did not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an accus@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the Democrats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his Special Ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that accelerated the work of the special promot@@ er in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be determined against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this draft , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become loud , he wants to obstruc@@ t justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
comm@@ ey said in June in front of a sen@@ ate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triggered speculation on whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to dis@@ miss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unlike an independent special negoti@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later rec@@ alled president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant Eis@@ berg is driving Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has loos@@ ened from the cow@@ ard &apos;s cow@@ ard .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , weighing over one tri@@ l@@ lion of tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and probably will need two or three years until it melted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for human beings .
according to researchers , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a background background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort was disturbed several years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete ice shelf there .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is in danger , as the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and disp@@ lace ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is the fourth biggest hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e of Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e would grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these scientists do not dis@@ rupt the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , many of the polar regions of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ cti@@ ca stretches towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years , counting on the areas where the temperature increases the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to ho@@ ur@@ ly at the staff
as it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls on the employers &quot; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the chal@@ k @-@ day took 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the Kreis@@ verwaltung in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously highly sought @-@ after .
there were 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
there are currently 50 un@@ occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann circuit .
among other things , physicians and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration will develop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demands on skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself internally and extern@@ ally , point out concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; competition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service illness or age @-@ related reasons .
high time to act , so that no more vac@@ ancies will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he caused quite a surprise even in the chal@@ k @-@ day when he publicly questioned the staff@@ ing costs and stun@@ ned the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked , which permit a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not arrive at a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county administration should seek a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials more than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are prescribed exactly , increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself to career years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ rik and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the tone of the NGO Mig@@ rants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for migrants in the Mediterranean if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities had confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express itself to detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are supplied to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can drive off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have mainly an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; of their ba@@ il@@ out actions .
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate Organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .
suits and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine test of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival throwing market .
again , there was a look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flakes &quot; of Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ lets brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ic@@ y@@ ine at the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sports
do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium in the wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high costs .
these have also recognised the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine , who are increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart who founded an e @-@ sports division in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must focus in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , it is possible to be present on these markets far more often than just once a year to send the German Government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sports , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA soccer simulation will be challenged at competitive level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established , in which the pros compete against each other .
and in Asia &apos;s 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes .
in addition , there are cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to manage when playing online , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of electric sports .
the players are on the road internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the company consultants Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband interactive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , turnover is expected to exceed 130 million .
that is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte Consul@@ tants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many countries are already on the agenda . &quot;
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .

there are also a lot of things happening in Europe too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says F@@ rob@@ bing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Netherlands and France , according to D@@ utt , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ associations are meanwhile obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing the ancient times is no longer enough .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align it with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that everything stays as it was always in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of Con@@ rad Roy &apos;s texts for suicide
a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended on par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the neg@@ ligent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took up his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psych@@ ic disease .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , folded hands and downward eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they utterly regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not we@@ ave the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I surround myself with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity . &quot;
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; persecuted &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person I have been with since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew attention to national attention after Car@@ ter revealed word releases that it encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is to turn the generator off and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter paid attention by the death of Roy and ordered it to benefit from any press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was sentenced in 2007 for murder by her British room@@ mate in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern does not trust the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and broad@@ ly on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush to his arm .
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner , after his first deployment as Bavaria Captain .
well , the objection would have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i could also suggest the sign of the coach .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f who came from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from the holiday .
sugar is most preferred to those you want to eat a lot , which you want to keep in your mood .
those who have been chosen to pass the legacy of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ mich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
to the right rear , that is now its position , the white band@@ age on the arm did its rest .
and at all Kim@@ i was working in this starting formation like the one who can best take the helm into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ att@@ un@@ ed tro@@ upe .
he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal &apos;s not to over@@ play his lack of fitness ( fol@@ ly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come out to the performance of the Asia @-@ journey ( also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver thus did not neg@@ atively fall into their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ ver ran alongside Kim@@ mich , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both operated in a sovereign manner .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ ver tried a few times in the game @-@ building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the outcome was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bayern @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one sees in connection with the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ ber@@ ly said goodbye to his new te@@ amm@@ ate after a few crisp statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ ver : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you simply have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ atine minister : economy pra@@ ises speed
it often turned out to be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V inquiry from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously charge the old minist@@ erial council .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around looks natural in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be the construction law .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the western circum@@ stance of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Office of Tourism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Minister @-@ correspon@@ dent Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees this as a sign to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier , as by Wis@@ sing , aims at the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine expor@@ ter , which has been sin@@ king for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euros is fores@@ een for the passed master test and 2500 Euros if graduates are independent within ten years of the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts are quick to create , at the same time out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Industry in Trier .
until now , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ sing in regional operations .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ ts , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 than proposed in the maintenance of provincial high@@ ways .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept as to how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies only evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it cleared the field again after four months due to dis@@ agreements .
Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers see themselves confronted with a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer the software to update in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW chair said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of dis@@ connecting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreciation devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back under normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to deal with the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated in the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could burden Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer is contributing dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar

in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to join , on Saturday morning a raft goes through Munich , which has a special message .
if it goes to Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the construction department wants to clarify .

it shows a garbage mountain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pr@@ el@@ ude to an publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a desirable game of wild should be sharpen@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already last summer , the raft sailed across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los N@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
at times , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published carto@@ ons in carto@@ ons , and the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still records and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he suggested , among other things , as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came in at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks continue to find its dro@@ l@@ ly figures worldwide .
for six years he has also worked on a cartoon and TV series with his characters .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - who has a jack of thousands as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he tends to rely more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is reproduced wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases transmitted insects , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great headaches are prepared .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively com@@ promised because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacteria that transm@@ its the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather , there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions which are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sha in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary this year .
festival highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval feast .
dealers , guil@@ ds , traders , vag@@ ants or a country ski camp will be able to experience these days in the city centre .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly magazine Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are to take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings reach .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ list or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and during the entire country there are more and more journalists : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter are their editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was set up in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime each year , journalists are seldom tried in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is more tra@@ itor .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little use to discuss safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve Flow . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing like silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms , which are bigger than many homes for the living .
remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have upset the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper which had released the same story to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his murder is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
in 2003 , he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined forces with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sell 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that you consider as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
now they ask : was his love for routine ruin ?
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the publisher of Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the space where employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobil@@ es allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen tried protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the government to protect the office of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who declared the Gover@@ nor himself un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters entered the mountain scenery , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has concentrated on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous man Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s home town .
and there was a group operating in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolutionary Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated almost the whole century all the political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I Govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid .
only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez have considered the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , which protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ bbed a few characters and went next morning to a demonstration for a further journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by writing down &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; protests and buildings in organized protests .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and let them kill because they told the truth .
she has since asked for her to be re @-@ classified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone lay beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the paper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va B@@ reach in March .
others continue to do what El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in a flat in Mexico City in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , states that drug traffi@@ cking frigh@@ tens him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , Ri@@ odo@@ ce &apos;s editors were sitting at the side@@ walk in front of the office and drinking beer , when all their phones suddenly began to h@@ um .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens were nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were scar@@ ed at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the road &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , even though a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
the report in &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the preserved , ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies in the world . &quot;
the Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has start@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was discovered by Sha@@ wn radio when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine close to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to better blend into his surroundings and avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of ro@@ e , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs rob@@ ber@@ ies of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Years have to have been , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal for references to his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r when he died went into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably more inland widespread than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just cro@@ w a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was discovered by Sha@@ wn radio when he dug near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the reserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long heads prot@@ ru@@ ding from his shoulders .

in the thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , long @-@ length jams - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) motorway ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , between the jun@@ ctions of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into each other .
there is no indication of the exact number of injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an easy to moderate injury , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of driving Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer back @-@ up was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it also occurred on the counter @-@ track to massive obstruc@@ tions - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade notes the characteristics of the vehicle bank@@ ers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident happened on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group test &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : no clu@@ e is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ening into his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ alo .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes one uns@@ afe or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the perfect ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and de@@ value the ticket .
currently , a test run is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be available for many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use it , some prerequis@@ ites must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already the most passengers do anyway .
it also has to be purchased via the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls on its ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears .
the train atten@@ dant gets a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train driver arrives at the ticket inspection at PLA@@ Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep quiet .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without a ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , check the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr Bureau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest issues .
because often one has , in any case , one of the co @-@ travellers not all the documents that one needs for de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad sen@@ timent in the section or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s own tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional mer@@ its on the same track are not yet enabled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else posted the information on their feed , they closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah has been continually ret@@ we@@ aned on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from St. Louis area was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , live on twe@@ ets .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police @-@ band and people crying , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who had a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video she said , another polic@@ eman said his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ pm , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened over the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance which consists in the sight of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter , carrying a flower dress and a suitable crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be drawn up .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camping area when the activists awaiting the possible non @-@ indictment of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was President of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
one question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by innumerable cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death det@@ ain@@ ees .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; team in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone talking or talking to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people are presented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , how she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ vely type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who was shaking this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black , gay woman stands as much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opoliti@@ cal atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has split the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
there is hardly any cold on the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some say one to bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; Das would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while advoc@@ ates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the business , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
this will end with the start of the construction work .
the Galerie @-@ makers want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle into the new building - and to the Bed@@ a Square with the opportunity to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women ladies always very gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing can settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping mall in Bit@@ burg ?
whether you wear clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I think that &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly sold directly from the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer .
it &apos;s a shame , specialty shops almost no longer exist and what remains of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit into Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall be located during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spec@@ ter bit gallery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already manage to exp@@ el all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
and there &apos;s no need for a shopping center empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmers market , instead of this gallery .
but thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - there is no room for a farmers market hall anymore - as I think - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the prem@@ ise of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible , hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a sentence of 35 years after being classified as secret diplom@@ acy news about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gender and vision@@ ary dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , how anyone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , albeit some intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since adol@@ escence , was convic@@ ted in 2013 due to 20 charges , including six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig associated with it .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ained M@@ use became an un@@ equal bri@@ stle , which , over the course of two years , exchanged several letters .
they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ le Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President was able to transform Chel@@ ring &apos;s judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually only few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ings released after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to continue fl@@ aming the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in the biological sense , we are all .
&quot; hopefully , what people will hopefully take with you is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , how she appears with a free talk of hands from the disciplinary forces of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they cold your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing didn &apos;t see the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res which gather together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee at the University of Oxford searched for killing
a country @-@ wide human race is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at the University of Oxford , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bites .
a common warning system published by the Police Department of Chicago indicates that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ rid , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them had now been assessed and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this study , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in touch with the police in the UK and are ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , strongly urge the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it is unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police is currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code describing the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause Russia to concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the D@@ oping sc@@ andal in November 2015 by the WA@@ DA on the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli commented that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
the company groups shared this with them .
it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not be assumed by any health impairment , it was said in the message .
from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ine anti @-@ lice drug .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company do not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ ep@@ tive .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is on the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software , which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to perform surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow executives to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite managers and contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees &apos; commitment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ Sur@@ ve@@ ys and Sur@@ ve@@ ys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low regulatory results - so that you can re@@ boot why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you will not be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ance where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , based on the Let &apos;s Talk pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
scent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
it has recently been registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent company lets companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously concealed by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practices can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February , Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought all his funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
the employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors can achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well . businesses run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , this can be dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , which has seen companies who have left themselves too much for collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why I should ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of employees in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day practice and makes a long day for the fry
it &apos;s up to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers chat on one side of the team &apos;s new training areas on campus .
some have stri@@ pped off their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players registered to the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the following morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it actually prolon@@ gs their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducting practical exercises in West wood for the first time .
20 before the beginning of formal play preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s control change even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over , which is not an easy task considering the clear line of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Centre , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective grid behind a door post .
brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set themselves there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send out more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit detection by third parties and then show their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight fake news .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to be pun@@ ishable by social media networks , if they fail to quickly eradic@@ ate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of fac@@ tions exagger@@ ated third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .

creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb @-@ print on the page of a letter in such a way that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &quot; s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb &apos;s print ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell for smoke , because at that time they lit a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest ) , this seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006 when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that show who owned what : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boys , let everything go ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion which occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher , whom the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is depicted from the 18th century , staging his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was dug up ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men redeemed their school @-@ related crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ fig @-@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf hidden
with the opening of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau by Thursday ) on Friday .
even until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as a highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that as a bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizen , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they compete with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ five @-@ figure amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
in Ankara , every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) deliber@@ ates on pensions and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week too .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions .
that was the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the army .
chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , will remain in office , but the officers of the army , the air forces and the na@@ vy were dismissed .
since the coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ iled Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the pulling attempt of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons , who are directly involved in the coup attempt , is being negotiated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the coup attempt as &quot; a gift of God &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; fully clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
on the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ f ban on female soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale laundry in the army and the security forces goes on .
in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan fired another 7@@ 3@@ 95 civil servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly regarded as the lords of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan drives specifically to Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an officer in particular warned that after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot;
if that is true , such a development would not allow Nato to get cold .
anyway , in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US Immig@@ ration Plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media .
it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries will be issued Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have financial resources to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race track shuttle
over the past few months over the past few months , there has been a dispute over the future of the race circuit - now it is supposed to go very fast .
even before the end of the year , the circuit on which the tourist rail runs , is to be built .
in order to ensure the long @-@ term future of the platform sh@@ utt@@ les , construction work will start in this year according to information provided by the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the costs for the repair of the route were estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country assumed 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , said S@@ üh@@ l .
the ministry and the southern Thur@@ in@@ gia railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be appointed as a regular one on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested , whether the route is used by enough people to order them again in the future .
in addition , the track is very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it could not become crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will get them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can &quot; adapt &quot; his robot to his beliefs &quot; and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or colour of his finger@@ nails .
but it becomes even more disturbing because many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ per woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible , &quot; says true Compan@@ ion &apos;s website .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spirit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , troub@@ ling one the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy served with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ?
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy .
its emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their increasing popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what tran@@ spir@@ es from the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
but there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has been pre@@ destined to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the winding body and the po@@ unding out eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply leave them away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to express it in the saying of 2017 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; service ma@@ ids &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
it has become a tru@@ mp card of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of the family of tru@@ mp .
we are all very strict to let our filter bags burst .
less noticed is the power of shri@@ mps to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ minded poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House each one whom she knows , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
around the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it is important to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we talk about &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gru@@ es@@ ome possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be expelled .
but there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing , which suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp were indeed a very mild crime .
if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cla@@ ir@@ voy@@ ant music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one - but a big round@@ about in northern London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , because here two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have been able to judge the car@@ ous@@ el I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ ologi@@ zing while I got tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , he was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der that hid in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too transparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosecutor &apos;s Office said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last one of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four@@ thous@@ es were fired from the arch@@ ers and the E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen during the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the secondary school students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
as a symbol for school dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 pupils of the four classes led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle , who grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
to achieve this , the m@@ lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of chicken , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make a chicken out of him was sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who bore cylinders to make the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said school@@ boy An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wanted every quarter @-@ guy to feel accepted in his new school .
it was followed by thanks to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps to Unter@@ richt@@ sen@@ g@@ p@@ äs@@ sen , and the parent representatives .
the time of the cu@@ cum@@ ber was over , explained class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , she only divor@@ ced her students , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they have been able to rely on the district wat@@ chers .
at the end , all students had a song of summer time and holiday time .
there was great joy in the children .

two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of people illeg@@ ally attacked in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , while an investigation is underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control over the free camp and put on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
the aim is to improve the emission performance of cars from emission classes Euro 5 and , in some cases , Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fit has been ordered by the Swiss Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet called for an exact date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler has announced to write to each affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done in its frame .
how long will the retro@@ fitting take place overall ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
foreign manufacturers probably would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE advises to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards by the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural pur@@ ge announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the honored .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series has already announced to refrain from participating in the gala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tru@@ mp to make her sights clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re in R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written - however , suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been a city builder for 31 years .
and the work always makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application is available to the requirements profile so far .
the city is looking for an architect or engineer at the earliest possible time .
in keeping with the regular notice periods - there is still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach serves as the sub@@ contractor for the administration community , the applicant must instruc@@ t appropriate degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they can no longer fulfill them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity of the citizens is important to the city and to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authority and the citizens .
over 30 years in ministry , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot are initiated .
the Kin@@ zig Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium refurb@@ ishment is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will cost around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working here is fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
design is available for a city building master of great le@@ e@@ way .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and landsc@@ aping , there can be very flexible reactions to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands as an ensemble of historic preservation , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the reti@@ ring city building master .
the mayor of the city is responsible anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of employee support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been involved for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker also wants his successor for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to use Roland W@@ acker , you should have a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture according to the town of Has@@ lach as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of construction planning and planning .
the Municipal Building Office is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , property management , municipal property management , urban building yard with building yard and urban gardening library as well as the Lower building rights authority , including monument protection .
bike thrown to pi@@ pelines : South @-@ way route closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ enen road ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night .
near the crime scene , a ro@@ sy wheel@@ er and a bicycle driver were witnessed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a region of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaking speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch at AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators would have put themselves in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delay minutes and the costs for rail freight transport , even pellets of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern track could be led without any obstruc@@ tions .
nearly ten passenger trains were dropped on Friday morning , two of them related to long @-@ distance traffic .
freight deduc@@ tions did not fall , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and UK 300@@ ,000 causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant in@@ feed .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in food are not penet@@ rating the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice carries a certain bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet tolerant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages more tolerant , less flamm@@ able intestinal mot@@ ility if the same system is also applied to people .
post@@ do@@ k@@ tor@@ an@@ din Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same stem , which was placed separately , did not .
she presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal flora of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but lacking them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed a intestinal mot@@ om and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism which is known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s feed , the number of cells increased by around 50 per cent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same toler@@ anc@@ erous cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; says Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his dé@@ but against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cks off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role , when people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira advance at will .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and only achieved 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho ad@@ mits that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u were also starting in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Boeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paints &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream@@ liner &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such ads .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
new depression for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still an SPD leader , S &amp; D Prime Ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
only no stor@@ ks from the central Party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the League - was the most important wish of the fighters .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the cow@@ or@@ kers from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz had received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were failures .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows that red @-@ green can not be reliably ruled out , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprise faction of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Land@@ tag election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German business manager Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ ests to return its mandate to return its mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transfer to the CD@@ U is a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the vot@@ er &apos;s will . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ hat@@ chet must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the German Executive Officer and campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens of the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ ghs an SPD election fighter when the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day &apos;s message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands out for the CD@@ U without his own government majority after over@@ stepping the green de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ ere started with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med down at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that was also the case - and it all became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel led the SPD to exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
the comrades strug@@ gled again in the weeks after that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with him came the next grav@@ ure .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD state chief , lost his nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong , which can be done wrong .
Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival ever since .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
for some time now , the lower Saxony &apos;s prime minister has been in criticism because of the VW exhaust system and its role in the Supervisory Board .
the survey results were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just because , in the past weeks , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s surroundings .
they let him give thanks , because they promised a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Mr Schulz does not at all .
for the time being , the comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians of T@@ ests .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ ester presents her own career prospects on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ ests has not been elected to the parliament for her person as a direct candidate , but has been elected to the parliament on the list of Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens , according to the Lower Saxony de@@ pu@@ ties .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins a &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the voters four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony &apos;s SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career distra@@ ction of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
funding for City core III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can get support from the country in the near future .
the mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler , and three representatives of St@@ eg city development on Wednesday , informed about this .
at the beginning of the inform@@ ational event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 it has been in sensi@@ cal areas of rehabilitation .
at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the present refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; achievement project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the development of the interior too , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a renovation area III .
the total funding amount amounted to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 euros would come from the country , the rest of the community felt sens@@ ations .
how is a rehabilitation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area to be rehabil@@ itated .
if necessary , the territorial limits could be postpon@@ ed again .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programme in which the re@@ group@@ ings would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a statute .
the licensing period for the funding period has been running until 30 April 2017 as of January 1 , 2017 .
until September of this year , however , the inventory can only be carried out within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation field to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the statute must be as follows , so that the next year will begin with the renov@@ ations .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that every commun@@ e had to carry out the said investigations .
it is a matter of evaluating the urban planning ab@@ norm@@ alities and deciding when to renov@@ ate and to what extent .
for the respective plot , there will be a rehabilitation note in the land register as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to his senses and make a picture of the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Got@@ zel , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and land arc , &quot; which includes , among other things , the structural condition and the renovation plans .
in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household appliance , &quot; information about size , layout and residents of a residential area can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be completed if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however to be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still insi@@ sted that the distribution of funds will work according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle . &quot; whoever comes first advises first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve subsidies for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that catches American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military &apos;s statements that have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior official of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter , which was made in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was exhibited beside a yacht of Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire bri@@ gade and a forkli@@ ft made out of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the Deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act provides federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you were locked up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was defined by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for political reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet proved against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America , &quot; showing products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead to training flights in the Washington area and in the South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ i@@ helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget desig@@ nations for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for tax rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Walter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND survey from 2015 , reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but account for the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter &apos;s use for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is natural to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
the championship leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga comes to the stand@@ ings of the third S@@ V table .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel at the stand@@ ings third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga has won the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays a similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the S@@ V @-@ S@@ V , imports from the high north are above all concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need a good portion of luck as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is practically standing .

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp did not really feel happy when he put his signature under the law on the tightening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least the draft looks to punish European companies that will help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then investors from the domestic O@@ MV , which together with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Sou@@ p North Stream 2 together with other European companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dr@@ one is enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .
twelve weapons are his choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into the spotlight in the hit series of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the world &apos;s most successful drug trade organization : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosec@@ uting authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bit and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on 1 September .
roll back : the city establishes 46 kitchen aids
the city again organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers the clock is turned back .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld res@@ umes the provision of food in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh air cooling .
the city operates 46 nur@@ series in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
last day of kit@@ esur@@ fing , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are looked after 45 days of the week in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day@@ time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies to 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff will have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the food delivered , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , give out the food , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen workers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s about eating healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , which it has proved to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self @-@ regulation and foreign exchange for the city , it is from the Press Office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are newly hired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours do not fall so strongly in the area of education for about 750 people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ eled at the elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ pres@@ idents and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban has published threats against a selection process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year the elections for the first time will be handed over peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make certain of its long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant in Glasgow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which in addition to other products Hob@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees and union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insi@@ sted on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; express concerns that funding would not be pushed forward for the modernis@@ ation of production lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of ra@@ bies affects our members deeply .
generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , in the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the Eastern end of Glasgow is urgently looking for a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ di said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , continuously review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our ra@@ bies , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and completely . if our operations change at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona have warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not follow N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after leaving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way out , although a source near the Catalan board insi@@ sts that the club has always done its best to take care of it since its arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned by the PS@@ G president three years ago in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car met him in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to ev@@ ade and tou@@ red the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au coming towards Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the neighbourhood of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car met him in his lane , so he had to move to the right .

there was no damage to the car at the end of the car .
the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the Mercedes driver did not notice the accident at all .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse falls reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication against the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the master master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pap@@ al Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of the processes .
the Vatican paper , &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that there were &quot; double standards &quot; on the reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday life experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a dev@@ out fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes have been a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they found it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , for the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the memory tape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber who was appointed by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) were attacked sexually between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ um sensitivity &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dome scrat@@ ches were sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be said that , in many cases , there were forms of physical and psychological violence by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students could be more intense .
nevertheless , contrary to many other accused , many victims under@@ estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explained why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence perpet@@ rated at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; in Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; firstly , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which has become tangible to the Ö@@ f@@ teren , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz does not produce top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found at all .
eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly exposed by any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool were also outside his sphere of influence .
it is possible to reproach him at best , to know about it too late or to have taken the first hints seriously enough .
the school gym@@ nasi@@ um on which he worked was felt by practically all respon@@ dents - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus , the broad majority of his disciples Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who provided the boys regularly with cakes , biscuits and sweets and &quot; always moved by grapes from children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to w@@ ou@@ ting out@@ breaks .
the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the mu@@ es@@ li on the floor , but also distributed ear fi@@ gs and put all too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he has already admitted many years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the period , the 1960s and 1970s , both with parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the non @-@ violent shooting at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are indeed dig@@ ging at@@ ells .
one wonders whether it is more likely to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just r@@ ushed upon him .
many people who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently at the Bavarian Pope .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media in connection with the report a lot was reported on the subject abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger included in the final report any involvement or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have committed themselves to the master &apos;s master .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was , however , that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even trust their parents and brothers , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators in a professional manner .
how do students assess R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student put it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see a case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely re@@ aliz@@ ations and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that it is calculated ... bugs more penet@@ rating or clearer or more open compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report concludes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the run @-@ up to students and / or their environment , the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far as sexual abuse affects , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus exemp@@ t from any co @-@ knowing .
he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to display .
therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these contradictory crimes , as it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent shooting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former master master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , right in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the primary school and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as other alle@@ gations .
in addition , the report treats incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir leader of the cathedral scrat@@ ches .
all the terrible investig@@ ative pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were har@@ assed and portrayed and suffered , were all in the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as most witnesses stress , the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; states .
what was different from the cathedral level gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot;
thus , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself , and from his predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then only around 1993 .
didn &apos;t Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut up the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary school will continue to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the face of the danger of negative press releases he recommended urgent action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity persi@@ sted , when audi@@ tors were also banned in Bavaria since long ago .
before that , they took place in a legal grey zone , as each of us knows well .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might have been exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permissible limit was actually exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the prison sentence was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis argued that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging the past for contemporary moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was left in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
it &apos;s all horrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. ear@@ thing and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was banned , he also strictly refra@@ ined from it .
in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger described the picture of his Regensburg time .
did the issue of Prü@@ m @-@ jail also come to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , the dome cats only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not deny that he carried a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this has to be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen - true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscuits and candy alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys are now no big singers and always stand before every success , right in the field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have really gotten to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experiences as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , of whom one cannot imagine that he could only do something for a fly .
I get regular contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most cathedral @-@ cats are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ectable person , to which they still look up today and that they truly rever@@ e .
and please , once more clearly : all that is accused of him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be glad that we have long since overcome this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a medi@@ ally sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is the evil intention behind it , only too obvious .
the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves it .
now the stand @-@ up would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has gained great mer@@ its and without the exception of Bavaria and perhaps no one else would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
