<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren Institute, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former land of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich is promoting exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a strapping road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but especially therefore very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickering carpet, which you can't recognize immediately.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called elemental leaves, were incorporated for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying authority between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops marched with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph further drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische surveying.</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "the comparison" "" "" "" "Early / Today" "" "" "" "is most impressive in the example of the state capital." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the creation of the map, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Lower sendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered plots from the so-called "original recording" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots of land now occupy no more farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is emerging north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the location of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's district, Au-Haidhausen not only reads the street name "at the" Gasteig "or from the hill" On the air "- but also in large letters" Irren Institute. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "" "" "" "At the Auer Lüften" "" "" "" "was created there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed to lead the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the purchase of the so-called" "" "" "" "Irren" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who occupied an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Cretsirrenian prison in Haar1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet at the Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected in an architectural style to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "the Marienplatz was marked" "" "" "" "Main Square" "" "" "" "in 1856, called" Kaufinger Gasse "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn track.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizens Rights Group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention when travelling by the state, as a number of questionable, rapid-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri Law, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the state prosecuting authorities who disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the warning message, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline during the trip and was put into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report of the Missouri's Office of Attorney General, showing that black motorists in the state are expected to be 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "" "" "said Chapel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people must be ready to take care allowance or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's Hassberge reporting programme, which ranks the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for migration violations, which will contribute to further race profiling in view of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have adopted the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "turnout project is fundamental." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidejn project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have given themselves a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local network met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Schwendemann family court.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates in five apartments holiday palaces.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwaldmilch" is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">Regionales only come to the table of the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischbach, he described the Weidezoning project as "elementary importance."</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I cannot manage to make profitable on such steep areas." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area cares for a lot of work, and much has to be machined with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "" "" "said Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parent company and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he did not conduct organic operations.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "" "" "the Commune recognised the importance of the" "" "" "" "Weidezaunching project" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers should be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and worrying about how to continue their business," "" "" "" "said the mayor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticized for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of open-mindedness area amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be forwarded for at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leaders, a quarter carried the community of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of fences," "" "" "" "explained Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landwomen it's not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "Peter Weiss also noted:" "" "" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Regional Courland Policies (LPR) Baden-Württemberg will enable state-of-the-art funding of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">Furthermore, the area to be enclosed must not be inaccessible (inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The motion of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a fence of almost 16 kilometres, is currently underway for the Fisherz Dudezaune project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The total cost of ownership is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 11,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's proposals to reduce the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller cannot handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and Liberty-Imitters would have retched him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked the meaning, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, which was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your ease, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who aspire to breathe freely, and the poor rubbish of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "" "" "there was never a time when the" "" "" "" "miserable waste" "" "" "" "was better seen on our screens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trump USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early Neoconservatives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes on.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh encountered somewhat unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted but hopeful people after long and often horrific journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "their statue is speaking to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch shall not enlighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is her only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete in the fifth world championship at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners.</seg>

<seg id="150">The captain's captain says she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers hit him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He fainted with criticism, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "in 1783, Washington said," "" "" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is only Facebook," "" "" "" "said many people." "" "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hot head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and decode his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">That is why the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum that is called officially, and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan Speaker's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people that vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not professional.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people are taking a position on the same subject, they will be disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the governor's employees referred to as "concentrated spam-attack" would probably call "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users that have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable porttos had a similar effect to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck him.</seg>

<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">2018 - all models should be taken together - 500,000, 2020 a million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to musk, 1,800 reservations are currently available.</seg>
<seg id="435">Those who order today a "Model 3" must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">If there are too much delays, then the obligation of reservations for Tesla could become a problem.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA CEO Pruitt retires because of delaying the rules of Obama-Era to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the environmental protection authority, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smoke-causing pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state's environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about a deadline expiring on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for" "" "" "" "ozone" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth. "</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations aimed at the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruitts's regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA often has not observed the deadlines for execution and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "" "" "" "said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and the authority which gives us serious." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">"" "" "" "nevertheless, the opinion of the EPA said that, at some point, Pruitt will use his" "" "" "" "authority to delay and all other legally available powers to ensure that the provisions" "" "" "" "are based on solid politics and the best available information."

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.</seg>

<seg id="456">The measure was not yet voted in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York General Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group intend to maintain the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the reversal of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumour celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Church, on Sunday, 16th July, at 4: 30 p.m., a Serenade was invited to the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16th July.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters of Tumlineage their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "" "" "Walter Martini emphasises:" "" "" "" "it is a unique village gem." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische primitive documents: count Hermann von Sulz sold the Berg with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Hill of Tumlinger, besides the former parish church, there was also a splendid farm belonging to which the church or the patronage belonged and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlings, the "mountain" is the third, the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to the year 1600 are based on these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A master who built a church, furnished it with a priest, still remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">It was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Greys of the two are torn apart at Christmas 1673." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but later it had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bellows were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from auditors.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm split the church tower and half of it rushed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the "Schaffy Rentals" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius plant.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers, the friends and promoters invite Tumlin on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">At the end of the serenade, there is a trunk in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view across meadows to the forest," "" "" "" "the organizers reveal the fantastic view." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for tumulls and hearing-welders.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters of Tumlinois feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini affirms.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to check the approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Boisheim resists" "" "" "" "does not see any legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council of the Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Boisheim" "" "" "" "association" Boisheim "" "" "" "" was called upon by Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes dissociation of wind power utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "recuperation" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">Although the city of Viersen had a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette few days before, it was decided that the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve it because of a failure.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirement, the granted approval decision is still unlawful and therefore also to take back," "" "" "" "said Christoph Erkens, president of" Boisheim "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break the City Council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government still stands out.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "Erkens:" "" "" "" "at this point, the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the relevant letters have been received in the circle Viersen since last week," "" "" "" "said a spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">They probably do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in content with the arguments of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four each 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city participates indirectly, had concluded a lease agreement with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, the City Council gave its green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a shareholding in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="533">The Business Association and the City Council want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract residents to shopping in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should sensitize customers to which offers their own city holds away from the usual supermarket goods.</seg>
<seg id="535">Accordingly, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>

<seg id="543">Attractive offers on Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened or opened again.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the city centre at shopping from sight.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to liven the inner city - to landlords, the companies of the whole city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">To overcome the lethargy with a network that partly wiped out, King had said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry in Mühlhausen, Germany, announced that the third "home-shopping" day, for the first time, will participate in five Thuringian cities for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="682">They work in several places in their volunteer year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually at the furniture fair in Steinfurt, once a week I help in Greven in the Furniture Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked in the open whole day at school.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it is a nice, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, i.e. a late-time volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does it come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I did Abitur.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">For me, I realized that it's wrong for me and I want to do something different with people.</seg>

<seg id="695">Make a social year, there's an insight, there you can see how it is on site, in the focal point maybe, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it so?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I have collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual studies, probably do a social worker education in Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?</seg>

<seg id="702">It probably always depends where you are doing your FSJ.</seg>

<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs off.</seg>
<seg id="708">In a different way than in civil engineering studies?</seg>
<seg id="709">Quantity: well, here it is not about calculating statiks.</seg>
<seg id="710">There are always other people who have a different story behind each other.</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of Swedish asylum-old assessment tests published</seg>
<seg id="884">Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They should make the assessment of the age more precisely during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor.</seg>
<seg id="887">To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older whereas in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "" "" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "" "" "possibly under 18 years old" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are fairly constant," "" "" "" "he said the journal The Local." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the agency published 581 tests and said there are 442 cases suggesting that the person is 18 years old or older. "</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet searched out the 581 published results, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, where x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">"" "" "" "if we cannot safely say that we should not do as if we could," "" "" "" "he said to the Metro." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="901">However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of assessing the child as an adult is low.</seg>
<seg id="902">"" "" "" "the biggest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="903">Fully in the plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a heavy-duty concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's great," "" "" "" "says Reinhold Leicht, foreman at the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the Presidency of the Government of Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the work began at the same time on all three renovation needed bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Easy is sure that the schedule will be kept.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come to the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively, 10.60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the north side got a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is an edge mounting, which is also used as operating road.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20 meter wide bridge should be used on Friday in the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridging caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special finger tip sensitivity has required the laying of lines by the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable, connected to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, first fish and crayfish had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the heron in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is controlled by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">The road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed for the construction of the bridge at the Lauterbach village entrance.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge denominations amounts to 700,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars moving to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure on European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the guiding organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money easy for Neymar to sign him and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich family of Qatari.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must object to legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had enormous debts in their quest for success, were effectively deceiving and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the liabilities of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich initially used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of FFP which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favour of the presidency in 2015, his successor, the UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare away from excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible at the UEFA for FFP, facing The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the sales revenues for the next five years amounted to 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has hit the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catalyst company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered a legitimate revenue.</seg>
<seg id="1142">That was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the sponsorship value of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar World Cup ambassadors will be ambassadors to find such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG via Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were unauthorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "accounts for the last fiscal year must be published." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going to see, and she tried to prevent Neymars leaving by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American Sport-Tycoons, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state which finances an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," "" "" "" "said Wenger on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey board chocolate has been made for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet collaboration is at the end of a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from Friday's newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on request from the news agency SDA.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products are checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," "" "" "" "said the speaker." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1165">Approximately 17 million small red-white pre-packaged food panels to 14 grams distribute per year the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with "Nordwestschweiz" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is always the advertising effect: it is a prestigious job for a chocolate producer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "how many applicants there are with the new tender will not reveal the Swiss." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1170">But there are only Swiss manufacturers in question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper article, Chocolat Frey will try to renew the contract in spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Chocolate boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter.</seg>
<seg id="1175">The opportunity to place the logo took Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline is cooperating with different Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long-haul flights customers of the First Class are pampered by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Shoggi by Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short circuit, both in business and in Economy Class.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of characters of the 80-er years, for the 90-er-years Grunge era (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter took the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" functioned surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humors (it contained an original story for an appealing jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By getting into the core of the gags - middle-aged actors are playing tight children, who are grown up - they still managed to win the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults, who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes beyond the watering can principle, including a riff on the Stalker movies of the 90 "s like" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. "</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character is rummaging through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from the year 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy vicious plot involved in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good general impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As usual, the exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is particularly fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's mutations of "singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random madness that this franchise could fuel up like a repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the bonds of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon now remembers another kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War by "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West ring combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice days to look at (the police spends time watching chess on TV, like Americans perhaps doing it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game "Finde the voice out."</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it is drawn, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"comrade Detective" who was edited down to a smaller length could better deliver his agitprop satire because Gregor and Iosef regularly visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a banquet.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Strike against drugs mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police have succeeded in a blow to the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="1213">At the same time, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years, and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officials ensured greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two persons were arrested at the time of the same raids in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians there were German arrest warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore probably extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of more than 300 policemen were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The Mafia's members are accused of organised crime, violent acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">As early as summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office Konstanz has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large-scale deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="1224">In the course of the investigations, mainly Italian nationals combined with reference to the Italian mafia.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Also a incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the account of the gang.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy with under 16-year-old children when they have returned from there.</seg>
<seg id="1239">It emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung."</seg>
<seg id="1240">According to the paper, it is said that BAMF is carrying out such methods "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to Italy since 1 June 2017."</seg>

<seg id="1265">The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members striving for an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on budgetary income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to curb the inflation heated by the Brexit and it said that credit costs would have to rise more than anticipated in the financial markets.</seg>

<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision on no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations on a rate increase and the GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2% to 0.3% in the previous three months.</seg>

<seg id="1290">NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by healthcare through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the assertion that the local authorities should finance him.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England head Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to make registration of people possible, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pretext prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in cases of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who come into question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable participants are identified which agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive sourcing.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Stevens said:" "" "" "" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">"" "" "" "it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1307">Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep, aimed specifically on vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="1310">"" "" "" "we warmly welcome this announcement." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "" "" "Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust said:" "" "" "" "the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "now as the prep test medicine was obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people infected." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">Sharon Hodgson, shadow Minister of Health, said: "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This effort brings us one step closer to the understanding of the advantages of prep.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne storage and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "that was my request," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the Architectural and Design Studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "" "" "he explains." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked over each other without having to bend." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "" "" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper beam window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Mirrored units are available at the entrance for all the tops and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "" "" "Erfan explains from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very important so that when you slide the door very easily." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional attachment in a home," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "" "" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can turn into something completely astounding by a good design and an increased square meter number.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation due to one of the largest real estate-empire Victorias worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">This means that Colin's property is worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," "" "" "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded it.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the event, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950 "s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first denim of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi died in 2012 hoping to pass on her property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment," "" "" "" "she wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis Group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "" "" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "" "" "Paul says" "" "" "" "about the conditions of its financial separation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015, Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can't really say much," because the case was before the courts.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others tried it and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump White House that he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relation to television extends decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry for unfair reporting it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were convincing," said the former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February against politicians. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "" "" "but the idea that Trump Twitter was ever" "" "" "" "under control" "" "" "" "is ridiculous." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trump Tweets would not have included more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep it away from him several times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with humiliating leaks, and to find out where they come from." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the president vigilant a printed copy of an article from Gottar.com, the website of the Internet provocatateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "being the source behind a heap of leaks in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of harassment, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that he voiced false accusations in the past and voiced it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "" "" "Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">That is good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the former ambience operating company ltd. on April 13, 2014 some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building offered the district council as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald was defending the hotel location and already spoke of serious interest in the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>

<seg id="1468">One does not want to position itself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to set up wide, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at the hotel.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: US Special Agent sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury in a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "" "" "the committee received the work in recent weeks, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "" "" "" "" on appeal to persons entrusted to the cause. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper regarded the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reports that there are already initial proposals for the committee in connection with a meeting between the Trump of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time actively interfering with the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between the Trump election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, there are to be several men who acted as advisers to the Republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">As a result, Mueller took a close look at more and more Trumps's private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the special agent Trump personally moved to the center and searched for the accusation whether the President could have obstructed the judiciary in the wake of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for the interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, invitations have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. there were also Trump advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his dam President Paul Manafort during the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction show that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "nevertheless, the establishment of the committee at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "" "" "said Trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "" "" "the topic gives the Democrats a chance to" "" "" "" "feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His Special Advisor Ty Cobb declared in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But they usually work in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "" "" "the White House advocates any action that accelerated the work of the special promoter in a" "" "" "" "fair" way. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the former FBI chief James Comey said three times that I will not be determined against the President." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">You have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because of this draft, accusations against Trump have become loud, he wants to obstruct justice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Commey said in June in front of a senate committee, Trump asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Following the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this triggered speculation on whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special negotiator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later recalled president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant Eisberg is driving Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has loosened from the coward's coward.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The Koloss, weighing over one trillion of tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and probably will need two or three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a background background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelhagus.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeira is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and abort was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice shelf there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C Schelfeira is in danger, as the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and displace ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C horseshoe is the fourth biggest horseshoe of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "" "" "he also confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen C horseshoe would grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these scientists do not disrupt the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, many of the polar regions of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years, counting on the areas where the temperature increases the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to hourly at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">As it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls on the employers "association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the chalk-day took 41 new places in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the Kreisverwaltung in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously highly sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">There were 620 applications for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">There are currently 50 unoccupied places at the Mettmann circuit.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, physicians and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "" "" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration will develop" "" "" "" "a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demands on skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orient itself internally and externally, point out concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "" "" "the speech is of a real" competition "" "" "" "" competition of public employers. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service illness or age-related reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1569">High time to act, so that no more vacancies will remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter peoples, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He caused quite a surprise even in the chalk-day when he publicly questioned the staffing costs and stunned the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked, which permit a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if we do not arrive at a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the county administration should seek a hourly rate," "" "" "", "said peoples." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials more than it actually foresees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are prescribed exactly, increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level, which orientates itself to career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy exacerbates the tone of the NGO Migrants "lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs to use the" "" "" "" "lifeboats" "" "" "" "for migrants in the Mediterranean if they do not comply with new rules for their operations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation since one year, refused to express itself to detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "" "" "said the organization in an opinion on social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes dinghy migrants on board, which are supplied to them directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can drive off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct boats like the Iuventa must have mainly an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any "essential changes or obstructions" of their bailout actions.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, Nobel Peace Laureate Organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."

<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine test of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were repeatedely longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can also be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>

<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew attention to national attention after Carter revealed word releases that it encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news, which she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>

<seg id="1692">Something was different on his place in the cabin, that Joshua Kimi saw immediately, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.</seg>
<seg id="1693">But as far and broadly on the second day of the Audi Cups no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer had to be seen, he made the rush to his arm.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the coach did not announce it," said the Confed-Cup winner, after his first deployment as Bavaria Captain.</seg>
<seg id="1695">Well, the objection would have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.</seg>
<seg id="1696">But Kimi could also suggest the sign of the coach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Not the eight-year old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf who came from youth players, debutants and especially from the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Sugar is most preferred to those you want to eat a lot, which you want to keep in your mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Those who have been chosen to pass the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimmich confirmed: "this is what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">On Wednesday the 22-year-old flattened as a mini-Lahm over the field.</seg>
<seg id="1702">To the right rear, that is now its position, the white bandage on the arm did its rest.</seg>
<seg id="1703">And at all Kimi was working in this starting formation like the one who can best take the helm into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions, tried to direct the unattuned troupe.</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had the view of the whole, while many others were busy with himself.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Vidal's not to overplay his lack of fitness (folly); Renato Sanches thus, on the devil, come out to the performance of the Asia-journey (also only partly); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süver thus did not negatively fall into their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot.</seg>
<seg id="1707">After all, it worked very well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">Süver ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both operated in a sovereign manner.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The well-occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, and in addition, Süver tried a few times in the game-building.</seg>
<seg id="1710">"" "" "" "his colleague Rudy admitted that the outcome was" "" "" "" "not as we hoped for." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1712">"" "" "" "game relocation, tempo change:" "" "" "" "I was also picked up for this style." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1713">As unusual this Bayern-world is still for the newcomers, one sees in connection with the game.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Rudy, for example, did not give in the catacombs one or two, but determines six or seven interviews.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimberly said goodbye to his new teammate after a few crisp statements.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"" "" "" "there he heard an interesting sentence from Süver:" "" "" "" "what is going on here, I have already noted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1717">"" "" "" "in Bavaria you simply have to win any game." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1726">It often turned out to be irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Economic Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V inquiry from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously charge the old ministerial council.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing attacks the desires of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest turnaround looks natural in infrastructure policy: the gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the priority list of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1731">This year the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be the construction law.</seg>

<seg id="1734">Natus sees this as a sign to support regional, but internationally competitive companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as by Wissing, aims at the wine of a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exporter, which has been sinking for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, praise the Chamber of Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The Handwerkskammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new Master Bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.</seg>
<seg id="1738">A premium of 1000 Euros is foreseen for the passed master test and 2500 Euros if graduates are independent within ten years of the master's training.</seg>
<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">With the planned road construction, facts are quick to create, at the same time out of the country the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the Chamber of Industry in Trier.</seg>
<seg id="1741">Until now, only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing in regional operations.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer the software to update in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions standards." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers, systems for neutralising exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of disconnecting the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back under normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were indicted, while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccho Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to deal with the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request that was concentrated in the United States has been extended.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the study could burden Volkswagen heavily: the luxury car manufacturer is contributing disproportionately to the win of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1776">Mordillos Noses and the laughter against the suffering</seg>
<seg id="1777">At times, Mordillo was one of the most widely published cartoons in cartoons, and the noses of his characters are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Even with 85, the Argentinian still records and works on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">"" "" "" "his message:" "" "" "" "laughter," "" "" "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he suggested, among other things, as a draughtsman for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "" "" "he once said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came in at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match, and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing table, working almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and clocks continue to find its drolly figures worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has also worked on a cartoon and TV series with his characters.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a jack of thousands as a counterpart.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D movie, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases transmitted insects, what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, great headaches are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively compromised because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a microbacteria that transmits the dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather, there are very many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weak.</seg>
<seg id="1804">"" "" "" "so we have fewer parts with essential oil." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions which are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resilient to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly magazine Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are to take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings reach.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's paylist or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and during the entire country there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are their editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "" "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Federal Attorney General was set up in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists are seldom tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little use to discuss safety, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as long as we don't know the" "" "" "" "why" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve Flow."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing like silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-story mausoleums for drug kingdoms, which are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Remember for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have upset the sons, presumed gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country following the confiscation of another newspaper which had released the same story to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined forces with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sell 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "" "" "he said at the time of the CPJ Award." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "" "" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "" "" "is a way of life," "" "" "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you must take over the task that you consider as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curb like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways," "" "" "" "to move drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where employees of Riodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobiles allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen tried protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the government to protect the office of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, who declared the Governor himself untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters entered the mountain scenery, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has concentrated on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous man Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures concentrated on the Governor's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group operating in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all the political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI Governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers of Valdez have considered the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "before we knew what happened," "" "" "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "" "" "El Flaco" "" "" "" "because of its slender body." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, which protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went next morning to a demonstration for a further journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder throughout the country by writing down "SOS Press" protests and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and let them kill because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked for her to be re-classified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "" "" "Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1924">Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "restless past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in "Current Biology" described it as "the preserved, armored dinosaur that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved condition has startled researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was discovered by Shawn radio when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine close to Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that these herbivores, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to better blend into his surroundings and avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta Markmitchelli to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that dinosaurs were hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of roe, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, strongly armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs robberies of the Cretaceous Years have to have been," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for references to his life, including his conserved bowel content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur when he died went into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as Südflorida today, and rivers and oceans probably more inland widespread than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early" "" "" "" "Cretaceous" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just crow a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was discovered by Shawn radio when he dug near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the reserved armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long heads protruding from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cutest still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rarely as a gain in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upward.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: no clue is sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>

<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use it, some prerequisites must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already the most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased via the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "" "" "for the" "" "" "" "comfort check-in" "" "" "" "works like this: one climbs into the train, calls on its ticket under" "" "" "" "My tickets." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test customers, a button for electronic devaluation appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendant gets a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train driver arrives at the ticket inspection at PLAY, he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, keep on working, keep quiet.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you want to travel relaxed without a ticket inspection by our train attendant, check the DB Navigator yourself." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2011">"" "" "" "second plus:" "" "" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest issues.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often one has, in any case, one of the co-travellers not all the documents that one needs for devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad sentiment in the section or large room and delays in controlling one's own tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this is only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2037">"" "" "" "I was angry and cried." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11pm, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened over the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance which consists in the sight of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell, with her daughter, carrying a flower dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camping area when the activists awaiting the possible non-indictment of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my activism changed completely after 9 August," "" "" "" "she said and noticed that she was President of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities."

<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "" "" "it's all come." "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question came to Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by innumerable cases of people, often from whites - in a community that profited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Like Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death detainees.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the "Whose Streets" team in the years after Browns's shooting.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community coming together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets" show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>

<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter Movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin, have shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>

<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an affirmatively type of action," when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity.</seg>

<seg id="2082">She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the premise of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible, hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a sentence of 35 years after being classified as secret diplomacy news about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and visionary dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, how anyone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit some intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since adolescence, was convicted in 2013 due to 20 charges, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detained Muse became an unequal bristle, which, over the course of two years, exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a Comic "Supple Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President was able to transform Chelring's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only few days after the book was released, Mannings released after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to continue flaming the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in the biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"hopefully, what people will hopefully take with you is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic-novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, how she appears with a free talk of hands from the disciplinary forces of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when they cold your speech, they have won," "" "" "" "says it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so never stop your mouth." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "" "" "" "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning didn't see the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacres which gather together like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped itself with Chelsea, like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2159">A country-wide human race is underway for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford, who are looked for as suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show.</seg>

<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it is unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>

<seg id="2192">Mutko's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded from the Doping scandal in November 2015 by the WADA on the implementation of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, Convercent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb-print on the page of a letter in such a way that was written by a double-agent in the 1700" s that worked for the Jacobins, "he says.</seg>

<seg id="2299">And letters always smell for smoke, because at that time they lit a fire because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest), this seems too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "" "" "then, at night he drank" "" "" "" "Whiskey and started to write." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, cards that show who owned what: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">"" "" "" "boys, let everything go!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base in English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion which occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century, staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was dug up).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men redeemed their school-related crises by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Eläfig-mäki, the terrain of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>

<seg id="2338">In Ankara, every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) deliberates on pensions and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So this week too.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the presidency of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the chairmanship of the government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2344">That was the number of civilians in the YAS.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is pulling the reins in the army.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, will remain in office, but the officers of the army, the air forces and the navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the coup, head of state Erdogan 169 has fired the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Exiled Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the pulling attempt of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 persons, who are directly involved in the coup attempt, is being negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt as "a gift of God" as he gave him the opportunity to "fully cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the heading "Unease in the Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">On the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the abolition of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the large-scale laundry in the army and the security forces goes on.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July Erdogan fired another 7395 civil servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly regarded as the lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they appealed to their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say that Erdogan drives specifically to Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," an officer in particular warned that after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad, the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If that is true, such a development would not allow Nato to get cold.</seg>
<seg id="2363">Anyway, in the Alliance after the purges there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army.</seg>

<seg id="2374">Over the past few months over the past few months, there has been a dispute over the future of the race circuit - now it is supposed to go very fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, the circuit on which the tourist rail runs, is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to ensure the long-term future of the platform shuttles, construction work will start in this year according to information provided by the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and rehabilitate Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this particularly important connection," declared Minister of Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the route were estimated at about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum, the country assumed 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalised, said Sühl.</seg>

<seg id="2384">As a result, the Rennsteig-Shuttle should be appointed as a regular one on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, a pilot plant has been tested, whether the route is used by enough people to order them again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In addition, the track is very bumpy in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will get them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can "adapt" his robot to his beliefs "and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepper woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible," says true Companion's website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "" "" "in spirit." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step to Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, troubling one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy served with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Its emergence and its increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the marginal zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">But there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has been predestined to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the winding body and the pounding out eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply leave them away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trump big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump card of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of the family of trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all very strict to let our filter bags burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of shrimps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-minded poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House each one whom she knows, including the republican kinship, with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it is important to me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be expelled.</seg>
<seg id="2436">But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appear as an epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump were indeed a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals are twisting to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clairvoyant music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, because here two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have been able to judge the carousel I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologizing while I got tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslach Stadtbaumeister, will retire in Rente next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - however, suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work always makes him great fun, as he mediates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application is available to the requirements profile so far.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In keeping with the regular notice periods - there is still enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach serves as the subcontractor for the administration community, the applicant must instruct appropriate degrees.</seg>

<seg id="2545">If they can no longer fulfill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity of the citizens is important to the city and to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authority and the citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and UK 300,000 causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant infeed.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food are not penetrating the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice carries a certain bacterium in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"" "" "" "the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet tolerant to tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less flammable intestinal motility if the same system is also applied to people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same stem, which was placed separately, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She presumed that the difference with the intestinal flora of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but lacking them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal motom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism which is known as an indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's feed, the number of cells increased by around 50 per cent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same tolerancerous cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2604">Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" to Nemanja Matic</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act provides federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commandant.</seg>

<seg id="2729">"" "" "" "the event" "" "" "" "Made in America" "" "" "" "was defined by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for political reasons.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not maintain budget designations for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "determining the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for tax rates is highly misleading," "" "" "" "said Walter." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication against the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the master master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Papal Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret about their own omissions or their then false evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican paper, "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that there were "double standards" on the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the grips in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>

<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen (Regensburger Domspatzen) were attacked sexually between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plum sensitivity" victims of attacks, 67 dome scratches were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it can be said that, in many cases, there were forms of physical and psychological violence by Domkapellmeister R..</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, punishment for the students could be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, contrary to many other accused, many victims underestimate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories with him in spite of violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explained why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence perpetrated at the Regensburger Domspatzen" in Regensburger Domspatzen provides a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>

<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as choleric and perfectionist, which has become tangible to the Öfteren, when a Domspatz does not produce top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly exposed by any suspicion of complicity or co-knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool were also outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to reproach him at best, to know about it too late or to have taken the first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The school gymnasium on which he worked was felt by practically all respondents - literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the broad majority of his disciples Georg Ratzinger describes him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "competent," "competent" and "understanding" as an extremely good-natured teacher who provided the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always moved by grapes from children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to wouting outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knead with chairs and threw the muesli on the floor, but also distributed ear figs and put all too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he has already admitted many years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the period, the 1960s and 1970s, both with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the non-violent shooting at the preschool, they are indeed digging atells.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is more likely to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just rushed upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who have never understood him are still working diligently at the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media in connection with the report a lot was reported on the subject abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger included in the final report any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no, no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have committed themselves to the master's master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "" "" "said one of those affected," "" "" "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even trust their parents and brothers, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do students assess Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student put it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely realizations and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that it is calculated... bugs more penetrating or clearer or more open compared to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "this is how the report concludes:" "" "" "" "in the run-up to students and / or their environment, the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">So far as sexual abuse affects, Georg Ratzinger is thus exempt from any co-knowing.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these contradictory crimes, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "" "" "in the media there was much of" "" "" "" "violent shooting" "" "" "" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "" "" "the former master master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report" "" "" "" "Look out" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, right in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the primary school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the cathedral scratches.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible investigative pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were harassed and portrayed and suffered, were all in the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatz gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "" "" "as most witnesses stress, the topic of" "" "" "" "primary school" "" "" "" "is taboo." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the cathedral level gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories with him in spite of violence."</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most, the accusation remains to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself, and from his predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then only around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Didn't Georg Ratzinger consistently shut up the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz gymnasium, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "in this he points out that" "" "" "" "the primary school will continue to practice the punishment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the face of the danger of negative press releases he recommended urgent action." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity persisted, when auditors were also banned in Bavaria since long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was actually exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the prison sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis argued that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "" "" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "" "" "historians are talking about the" "" "" "" "snare of anachronism" "" "" "", "i.e. the danger of judging the past for contemporary moral standards." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what was left in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all horrible and I'm glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, i.e. earthing and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was banned, he also strictly refrained from it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">In the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope" Georg Ratzinger described the picture of his Regensburg time.</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the issue of Prüm-jail also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, the dome cats only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not deny that he carried a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this has to be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen - true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, the unruly boys are now no big singers and always stand before every success, right in the field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience as Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have really gotten to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experiences as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heart-good people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could only do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regular contact with him, like many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most cathedral-cats are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectable person, to which they still look up today and that they truly revere.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that is accused of him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can be glad that we have long since overcome this time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2995">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a medially scapegoat." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The report, which has just been published, relieves it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the stand-up would be a 93-year-old man who has gained great merits and without the exception of Bavaria and perhaps no one else would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
