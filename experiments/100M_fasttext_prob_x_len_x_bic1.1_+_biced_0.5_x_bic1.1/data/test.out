28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a tight family and we will miss it pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this serious time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia claimed that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went up . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; he shared with Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
combining his way with his family was to always cook something for us , prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , it was this un@@ polished diamond that lit bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SF@@ PD about 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
that &apos;s what the Hollywood star made in an interview un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or get stuck from the outside label , which have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not wish to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more sn@@ app@@ y to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of the TV with loose d@@ ash and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the white glu@@ t she brings the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sports Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden World Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses .
he let his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even shoot himself for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala .
there is no lack of awards to the li@@ ke@@ able athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver bay leaf , champion tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already spotted him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the Sports Py@@ ramid .
in Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been fo@@ stering offspring .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master champion was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; on Saturday .
the winners include athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ver , the former Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ro@@ wers Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the show jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion where the Lav@@ azza prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two U.S. presidential candidates are un@@ divided into tax and energy policy as well as a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely go back to regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand Clinton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has opportunities to open and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in that it must be invested , say Tru@@ mp and Clinton almost verb@@ ati@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so there could be party internal discussions on Tru@@ mp .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more significant .
Tru@@ mp plans to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining again in the US .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate it .
Clinton , on the other hand , explicitly plans to expand and demand renew@@ ables with its investment program : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ ed trade agreement , do not want to sign it .
at the same time , however , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid even better , says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
he wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is Tru@@ mp who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics believe him that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton who wants to demand at least from the rich is that they pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralised homes for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs established the establishment along with Pro Famili@@ a and Munich &apos;s women &apos;s aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they come in Germany , are Irish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and , at worst , ab@@ used .
this means that about 90 per cent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are surely not voluntarily born . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not dare to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodations only for them , asks B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their sphere of competence , some reply with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing as accommodations of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , in some community establishments , there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are hosted separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or become men and women together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read on the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily create a second house .
assistance specialists strike : demands for new labor disputes
representatives of the assistance specialists have called upon their union to approve new labor disputes in relation to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire council to approve more work events from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC claimed that it would have missed ministers to respond to the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance specialists and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and request official re @-@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to approve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work events commen@@ cing at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistant doctors of this year struck six times , the first overall out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A resident Dr. Johann Mal@@ a@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract terms that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he divided BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 practitioners and medical students , with the conclusion that the treaty should be advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , the health minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter @-@ player in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed slim and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined conditions .
Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything worse .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite .
but a sustainable cool@@ ness eman@@ ating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling back on Russia .
the offen@@ se was even greater since it was committed by a put@@ ative boy@@ friend .
to rebuild the Vet@@ ter will be difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
the most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he disputed this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been removed from his office last month by a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ Dem@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
in addition , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and l@@ essen the relationship between Turkey and the West .
the Russian president won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to me as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that are hur@@ ting themselves from the West and now al@@ lied themselves badly .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours at the press conference , both pres@@ idents express that they had not even stri@@ pped the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster - when NATO member Turkey broke out the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders would at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Board of Directors of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand can only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ user brands .
she supported international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralised headquarters and stock exchange listing are changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for the private client business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor @-@ mark as well as the brand among which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , for how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone in Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori who previously won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori calls on the che@@ er when he clin@@ ches victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ si@@ eger , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career perspectives
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for race , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusi@@ astically fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already caught 6000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already won almost 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a number of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Seven , in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t finished yet - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least fifty years of age .
Russian Putin fired up Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s stric@@ test confidence in many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environment and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin it is said that without stating grounds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been his deputy since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as Head of State on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and had recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are you convincing the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff re@@ treats at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
is this the result of a type of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at present .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president - would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed on great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to trust compla@@ ining items for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as Putin &apos;s third term had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his resignation in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his cancellation on Thursday .
there were artistic differences and differences in opinion on the set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ sons is written out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od over the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible now .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans we can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .

Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lashes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economic Affairs , Keith Brown , visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering work of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
all in all , nearly 79 % of the entire deck deck is on its place and the last section of the deck today finds a g@@ ong for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter represents a significant milestone for every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high and civil engineering .
after installing the last section of the road and its connection with the North Tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern rail bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an ascent of approx . 3 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the toler@@ ances on which the team is working , they were tiny - they were just a few milli@@ meters on each side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were dump@@ ed by their fishing vessel in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI ambul@@ ance station struck by 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have blown the boat out of its range until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the Co@@ ast@@ al rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it released the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic rob@@ ber dis@@ car@@ ded the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 44 year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
she then aler@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds favourable apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do we react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also develop on the stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great dispute in the town hall is , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such surfaces to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new municipal housing development programme , which will cost millions and will still be financed , will provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few rules as possible .
the left wants to impose tough@@ er conditions for investors .
despite this , as viol@@ a , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market has van@@ ished .
if the action plan is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the experts .
but the programme is not entirely up to date : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one compensate for the loss of further around 1300 inexpensive apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
only by 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent this from happening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nicole Palm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should now be bought out from the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring the apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the west town .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the western city , deadlines are coming out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be found there back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing associations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the West town is drastically increased again , the aim of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few parts of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Group , Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go by boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play anymore , but rather prefer spending their free time on screens has been pla@@ gu@@ ed by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , they can be &quot; photographed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game has led to a considerable increase in steps taken back by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch who pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of pursued people that train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data for performance enhancement .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; take 30 minutes of time to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day &quot; push on deaf ears because many public messages are dull to health and come from people who look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are thus covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always there are also gru@@ m@@ bling game @-@ per@@ ks , which always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be re@@ trac@@ ted over time .
due to poker success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world , helping many people to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

and now , finally , Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast took part in the multi @-@ campaign title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alists Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .

Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was waiting for her last test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a last over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment .

this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became the force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina slightly led through two turns , the picture was sm@@ ashed .
floating beams and floor ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the bri@@ m beam - and put on it on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her en@@ der@@ g@@ ust - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured out on her glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke in Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a head start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her soil exercise , she threw kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding tweet from the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mass mur@@ der@@ ous hearing in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl died , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , since the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic homes within four months and two more were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , announced at the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a bul@@ let out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund is micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder beyond which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t let myself on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course one has left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and you were told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first response was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund considers &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ ca@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the infected virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ ca@@ virus .
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to call out the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday overnight with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened to flood after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service om@@ itted that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall into the rain in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to ra@@ ined in the mobile area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near the nearby Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension is a danger , as these rivers are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.@@ 00 on Friday .
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ves on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight .
he said that another step &apos;s son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and streaming in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said that she had never seen such a high level of the river during the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ gol@@ fer would have saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in glo@@ omy , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread &quot; quickly , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer , near Liv@@ ing@@ stone , reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground was completely absorbed by rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of people from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and a failure in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated into two churches , both of which were now flooded .
the leader of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller told that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets which were washed out by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to return , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , nearly two dozens of roads were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his details , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as in@@ und@@ ated , but not reported on Friday .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents indicated that Brown was suffering several shot injuries including the loin , leg , arm , and abdominal muscles , but that he was in the hospital while being transported to the hospital .
&quot; he did a lot , his small body was ri@@ dd@@ led by bul@@ lets , &quot; he told his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the broad@@ caster that he is expected to recover again .
he would have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that there was apparently a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , were paraly@@ zed by the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a perpet@@ ual struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were sleeves .
it seems that there have been several armed fighters here , who were very active , &quot; informed police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no ar@@ rests and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a squ@@ ad@@ ron in the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ covers himself and the police are still looking for a suspect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympic cup in gymnas@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and second : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lic@@ in , round off , makes everyone proud .
this crew finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female female gym@@ na@@ sts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
for the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tics routines .
on Thursday , Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see turn@@ around in the whole country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to bring it to the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily in private gym@@ n@@ astic societies that are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these sports clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment for the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started working with the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to enable the communities of au@@ n countless young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable , easy @-@ to @-@ access gym training .
I founded my Turn@@ foundation for 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gym@@ n@@ astic in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this crew that brings thousands of young girls to interest the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the olymp@@ ic team gold and thanks , she motiv@@ ates her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance doctors would like to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance doctors who voted with a vote refused to reject it .
in July Hun@@ t &apos;s plans revealed to forci@@ bly introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract containing changes to noc@@ tur@@ nal and weekend packages , in order to improve care at un@@ favourable times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistant Doc@@ tors , announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance specialists have made a serious concern to the proposed agreement , in particular that it will heat up the current financial crisis and to treat it to treat all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by discussions prompted the government to engage in resistance and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
it was a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise the vibration and address the worries of the assistance specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he did not do this , the assistant doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work events .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to provide medical doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A aims to provide a better weekly remuneration for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labor struggle measures do not achieve anything that little , but already burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
over the past two months , we have spoken to the Committee of the Assistant Doc@@ tors and responded positively to the concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who are returning from a professional time , training opportunities , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ations and the Ministry of Health in compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people suffering from heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty materials in the ar@@ tery walls that form floor@@ ings .
if the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the flow of blood to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot det@@ aches , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the pipeline project of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who had already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness : political Cor@@ rect@@ ness flour@@ ishes in Muslim territories
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the insti@@ gation of a government report for corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed .
Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to have ignored any evidence of abuse due to &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption econom@@ ist , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police were allowed to set off shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral boo@@ ths to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a reference to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud , but should also protect the municipal government against the broader corruption and financial fraud that comes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral campaign in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of im@@ itation in which one person as someone else chooses .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud in the whole country .
he vo@@ iced in particular al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of mail - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding ID to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof has been aff@@ i@@ xed that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , in particular women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; percep@@ tions of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activ@@ ist manipul@@ ate let@@ tering documents to stop &quot; election harvesting . &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the poll@@ ing directory to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .

Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral district has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy to corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

crazy about Kate &apos;s bi@@ kers and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are out of hand this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , which has proven to be an impressive double @-@ singer of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic team is by far not the only one to compete with the gold @-@ fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the American team in bow shooting Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin on the bicycle race track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain arch of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio might be .
the team member of the American team in the bow shooting Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like a wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no big simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I do it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is supposed to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African S@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one way higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
a further ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a points out more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resemble an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar face @-@ form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the simil@@ arities
theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US soccer star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ shape and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the tower Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile which resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swimming woman &quot; went off like a low &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming relay .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; paint , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old chin@@ ese has lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited , he went as low as a pig , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
Chinese swimming woman Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming relay 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China .
spectators throughout Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the tone and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ awa twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming relay for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old chin@@ ese has lost the union , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many made him speak .
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC stream , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment about a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for over 90 times with the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed and delivered a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our folders in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ er and not on her as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming relay in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ er and not to her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by women who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the midst of business
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she dis@@ car@@ ded as she looked at it , drew her out and put her back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried out four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tasted the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear she put her back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the lay @-@ out , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and trousers and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , went back and forth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to bother anyone watching someone - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 Living in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how un@@ fortunate to think someone would take home pants that had a different person and who were not washed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman wore them and pulled out and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
if you are approaching from behind , you should turn around as first so you can see your attack@@ er and go out of the firing line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder , before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
hit him with his knee into the gro@@ in and twist , while the attack@@ er bowed before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight to the gun at the same time and beat the attack@@ er to the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is most secure to hand over your money - provided that you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller with@@ drew his immune system and th@@ rows of hearts to a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook off his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a pur@@ ge button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before the le@@ aking of each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea of le@@ aking the pur@@ ge button of a pull toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his trip through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public rails to stations to r@@ ins@@ ing buttons of toilets , the task posed its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he did justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial period showed a lumin@@ ous figure of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ ous figure was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th , &quot; showing the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble than that !
I will not lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th &quot; was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying that we told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directing , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others , in which it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all surve@@ yed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ tion social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social dwelling after a del@@ o@@ tion with a damage of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ led were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative &apos;s staff shocked the property in an irre@@ parable condition .
the walls were scrat@@ ched holes , wooden panels were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private shelter
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had joined , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ des and floods .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood boards were torn
neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly by the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner by force this week by force after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to sur@@ pass voluntarily .
the del@@ o@@ gion was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we are saying the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have missed the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
on the over@@ grown side of the village house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant ab@@ dic@@ ated to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as a del@@ o@@ tion is always the last step considering Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have bra@@ vely approached us and have given us the information they have provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and give the message that anti@@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ tion on the floor .

tourists in Portugal reloc@@ ated after an eff@@ or@@ tless military jet patch flies
sun worshi@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese p @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force deployed an incredible crash flight
the air strikes announced that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk occurred .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they began to worry about the noise of the de@@ bris , without seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would drop on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro used to panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet drove a little deeper than usual due to bad visibility due to the bad visibility of the area . however , the air forces insi@@ sted that safety was at no time at risk .
land fires destroyed part of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where there were also four people on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which limits his sight .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards FC Sevilla , the re@@ play climbs three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ man must refrain from playing with the under@@ lined Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europe League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who won the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , there is also missing Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German experienced a knee @-@ change in the knee , which clari@@ fied the entry question at Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from making a clear decision in this respect and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen became the winner in most of the remaining competitions .
before the first mandatory match of the new season there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , which was hum@@ bled on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ fes@@ al@@ op@@ p vs. S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince .
Sev@@ ille once again di@@ gest@@ ed the 2 : 3 defeat for extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and asp@@ ires to triumph in the Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .
with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in a separate league with table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the World R@@ ank@@ ings First ranked the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and the Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected into the final game and made the title one with each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ mine from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them .
they had withdrawn into the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their cont@@ actor in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches to this place I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said logical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the match , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag .
the match itself was unexpected one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang in a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , the expected tor@@ r@@ ential match did not develop .
nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking air changes to be seen .
Mi@@ z@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ am@@ char@@ ov , the White Russian had a ri@@ pple injury , after that he was in medical treatment and had to settle &quot; finally &quot; with tin .

Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &quot; huge problems &quot; in election campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now had weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary , usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident , expressed something like concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt was wrong reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media attention .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by the Sur@@ vey@@ or USA from June , Tru@@ mp and his competitor complain about the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question as to how he wanted to stop Clin@@ tons &quot; advance : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not do anything other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , Tru@@ mp added .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party is said to have threatened to strike funds for the support of its campaign , it should not be able to present better results .
instead , it is hoped that the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans will be stronger than their arms for Congress .
Olympia : tri@@ ster fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face disaster after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
after a fraud test at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee promptly dealt with a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials told me that the former S@@ printer and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er .
this was reported by the team leadership K@@ eni@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and was issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , released and signed the trial , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to the Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing trials , Kenya has been under special scrut@@ iny for a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was unusual to note that athletes from Kenya and Russia should be targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put much pressure on African land before the summer games in Brazil , creating an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya participated from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms with the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alle@@ gations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting .
member of the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und was calling for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
in this way , it was possible to prove that , in this sport , surface @-@ covering and systematic restra@@ int became apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
Salzburg : the West Side Story , Le@@ gend@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth space .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say that it is very Latin American . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up to date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ky Americans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same themes , and they are as meaningful today as then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had prepared to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school@@ girls from the east of London asc@@ ended to a plane in the direction of Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says that in the event of an election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , Leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
since its nom@@ ination , the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked the approval of Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference to select Gar@@ land with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a speaker of Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked to Clinton about whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge of the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the gar@@ land nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp is un@@ fit for the Pres@@ i@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants N@@ ude Calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mers to release a 1970s @-@ inspired Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine differs from Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
it seems that the calendar also does .
&quot; we need to return to portra@@ yal timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the release of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally with an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish municipality counts on mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ based foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ ds community in Germany will reck@@ on with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it might even become &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany in the medium term , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; on Friday .
because the government has already over@@ taken Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal fac@@ tions several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey .
after the dec@@ ei@@ ving coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that assimil@@ ates refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
that is why Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission chief called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany too , there is a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer anni@@ hil@@ ates teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; those who are not adapting and ano@@ in@@ ting Erdo@@ gan are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and secular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ based foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , relying on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks presented the biggest group of asylum @-@ justified asylum seekers in Germany before the coup .
on the reporting date June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus just under 29 percent of all recognised as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no such thing as war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum rights under the Basic Law are strictly political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia shouldn &apos;t choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
in 2021 , the Sunday election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
more stupid than so far it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ to @-@ day elections - that bites itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaign fighters , are on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems for this : during the holidays hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and vote in the end will only work hard .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign just below the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his major posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as it already did his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the right time at the right time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ res@@ ahl@@ kreis is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Sachsen as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the north @-@ east CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign distances on market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ ert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has noticed that in the country you crum@@ ble the base that it has to be very hard to find a wire to people again .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely exists in the expan@@ ses of the country .
the advice of the CD@@ U electoral fighter Kok@@ ert to his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants , however , is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : bri@@ ghtest , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of holiday need and move their election campaign largely into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls the regional leader Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , green campaigns embar@@ k on the search for local stimul@@ ators among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only around 8@@ pm , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty cru@@ mb@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October , everything should be finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject shall also be praised for the construction of those responsible for construction , for example when it comes to setting up hous@@ ebo@@ at trips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site was emig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again consists , the traffic situation within the village was relaxed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens can now continue on both sides from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passing of the place seems to go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there were some considerable discomfort , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King , responsible for the traffic management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ el@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were looking and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the signs .
what led to the fran@@ chis@@ ement of some trucks in residential areas .
as speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality also called for M@@ ös@@ singen &apos;s measurement vehicle .
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself competent on the spot .
two to three per minute have been inj@@ ected .
the fastest was at 77 km / h in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , it has become more cal@@ mer .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now the street is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales out@@ breaks for them , everyone can look through .
however , some more and some are less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are therefore produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences .
also at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum slight drop , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; the run @-@ track is missing . &quot;
the most crowded places are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must be happy about every Euro turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he quotes the sales losses to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planting has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back two years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his staff have to be dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , with the indication that the restaurant would benefit from the benefits of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other districts where something more generous has been handled .
for all claims , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history .
that other regular guests now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t go down , it &apos;s also nice somewhere else .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family members come back to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis he has experienced in her long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of the fight against terrorism is constantly being scre@@ wed to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , the Minister of the Interior of Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package .
but what has a thing to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the verse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ demand anybody .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was situated on the results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the latest proposals in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère took a little time before presenting his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , pointed out : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is launching a second attempt on proposals that had not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ cking jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still believes this to be reasonable and does not demand anything in the case of the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are also presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have it in themselves : he is planning a quick @-@ release process for deport@@ ations and more opportunities to incar@@ cer@@ ate people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of suspi@@ ci@@ ons for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than to date - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to mask their identity .
some of this is politically and legally delicate .
some people are still un@@ extin@@ ct and leave questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the im@@ balance of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about safety in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly employed people did not let themselves be cl@@ inging to election campaign times .
the inner security has moved enormously into the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking their position on the subject of internal security .
in the past few days , between the two parties it went up high .
only a gar@@ ish argument about the equi@@ pping of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some of the interior ministers , in which the departments demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a return from a double @-@ pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have fixed the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ open it is not sensible .
and in the case of a bur@@ ka ban , he had constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally fixed at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself .
there is a lot of things that could cause stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is also currently trying to benefit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen got off lightly .
in spite of diesel fuel , the delivery figures worldwide are increasing .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
there is confusion about a term in the recall campaign .
Volkswagen starts restra@@ ined demand in the second half of the year .
despite the diesel shareholders , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus thanks to its many brands and some good @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ening especially in Western Europe and again charged the total sales , as the company announced in the Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold 4@@ 4,@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
market sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker data from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had a reluct@@ ance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU , too , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas has escal@@ ated first , a minus is also available .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected household brand of the Nieder@@ sachsen got off lightly by the diesel @-@ sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only one distribution minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales head Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sales growth from January to July .
in this period , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated by a software exhaust test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer points out a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed certificate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after conversion , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
legal entities are the reason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for old diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirms that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my enquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting do not take place and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; warranty , &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel .
with the long term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen can see the possibility of customers coming to a workshop for example six months after the change@@ over - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the interests of the customers , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , there is uncertainty about possible warranty regulations , as it meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future criminal charges - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers need &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent penalty interest .
this fee is charged by Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time , he kept 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot put up for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs are now further reduced .
letting the cash simply lie in the ra@@ ins of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Executive Committee .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other types of investment .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course creates significant costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with penalty interest for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking Association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is more abund@@ antly equipped with wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s free money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no further banks are known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken und Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative vis @-@ à @-@ vis the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and competition from investors is a threat to competition .
the customers in Germany do not like this in their width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lon@@ es@@ ome middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before you rush to the comment section to see it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ ary Men &apos;s age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in millenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des of hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers reserve their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest grey suit and ro@@ aring wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and tell something more demon@@ ic like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , the I of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dressed the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his dispos@@ able income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media team , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and can see to buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have led , people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their disks again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to fans of the record carnival of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores have a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted an infrin@@ gement of the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record sleeves , of objects that awake happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not listened to it yet .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I fl@@ atten through a stack to bos@@ sa nov@@ a compilation .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ less , less music @-@ like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the record to almost an entire floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of newest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ @-@ packed Pop instead of experimental jazz dru@@ mming from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity with the customers .
none of them looks strange but na@@ iling psychological trauma is hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been in business for several minutes and considers the variety of records available for sale .
it rather makes a window bum@@ per than a big buy @-@ in .
it does not earn much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression to mu@@ zzle the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls , who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cro@@ ce record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; panel art &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could make more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they are not taken into account at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not by stro@@ lling through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through panels , while they steer clear of the star@@ ry view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old er@@ ron@@ eous host who hangs over the shoulders of nau@@ ghty middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer for demol@@ ishing shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should have jurisdiction to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dresser services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which sal@@ v@@ age a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary transactions , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; are absolutely understandable . &quot;
judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places threatened by the Nieder@@ reis@@ sen was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is operated generally and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the J@@ ell@@ ell@@ ent living has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic Games , cycling pro Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to be under@@ mined .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and continue fighting , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly it is hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in silence what reasons could have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time of the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this also includes my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fab@@ ian C@@ anc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km .

here comes the Enfor@@ cement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash@@ es are tested , which are supposed to transfer Tem@@ plates particularly effectively .
the futur@@ istically acting Enfor@@ cement trailer from the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at the severity of accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the Enfor@@ cement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with Laser @-@ Meas@@ u@@ rement , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to manufacturer .
so that it is not cl@@ apped easily , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also fire @-@ safe outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the specifications of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
UK fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold fet@@ ches
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji gave a master class in handling , side step@@ ing , back , line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was won by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but independently of this Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in its best form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former chief for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan , she lost each game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
fi@@ ji started wonderful and left the attacks G@@ Bs out of fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if you were running in running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au he@@ aped up in the corner .
with four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent tor@@ ch@@ light of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leon@@ ean N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ova went down a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still more than one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pushed through further weak Tac@@ tics of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB still se@@ eded .
this is how it is .
GB resulted in basic changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for entire four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ elled and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ amen placed the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked cr@@ ushing in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the coach to a ru@@ dder victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that wants what &apos;s called .
from the first stroke up to the last 220 tough h@@ ieve that go into history Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all present when she led to the second Olympic med@@ ley in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9th un@@ plu@@ gged insert , which is also unparalleled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ le@@ tics who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of triumph .
behind each gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was more readily available than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ked something .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that was what they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment early 2014 , out of season , which kept the break to a minimum if that was the right concept in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and walked around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning with it a little more than anything else and tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . it might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to finish , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very in the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not eager to do something great .
today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 31 years exemplary clarity provided
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water utility association as a model for large water producers .
so it was called the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk ( Bavarian Radio ) some time ago .
a little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , stands for 28 years as Managing Director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , annually promotes about 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water and provides 32 locations and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are municipalities of Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further cities and municipalities , there are water supply contracts .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water company in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work through office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renov@@ ations of water pipes .
there have been no stal@@ em@@ ate and I have always resum@@ ed innovations , because water is life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over the age of 31 .
he used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and he really lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a genuine practitioner , he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate cutting in front of the Wasser@@ forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised the Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who had worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water keeper and he was a loyal scar@@ f .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the rup@@ ture at the elevated tank near Kirch@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because it was filled with hoses from the high @-@ rise reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and will now learn in private in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that lies two years ago when I sang at Scala in Milan , he remembered nothing , &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko .
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and stated that he shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly prosec@@ uted .
now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters large , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bal@@ dness .
meanwhile , the police published a photo of him .
however , it &apos;s a few years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any information regarding the departure or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say more at this moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - light view for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens that the sector threatened from the green electricity production are from the table .
it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Survey at the existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations we could finally reach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gas from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent is advisable .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity production .
as a result , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation worsen@@ ed further , when the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw massive steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel con@@ glomer@@ ates price dump@@ ing .
during this spring , the situation somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties on import steel show effect ; on the other hand , economic prospects in China have risen .
it is not clear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp alone did not want to exclude closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel producers remain cau@@ tious .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same period of the previous year , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity produced now returned to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects an increase in output in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing does the sen@@ iors well
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
by the way , she does something good in her health and spirit .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German sen@@ iors division .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp also has this experience in her choir : &quot; to speak and to organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the pu@@ dding quickly even in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elderly people often have a very special effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &quot; organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations the singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
by song lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia suffer@@ ers are reli@@ eved of long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head also requires special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows by singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience reinfor@@ ces .
good reasons to start singing is enough .
those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors &apos; choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers at scre@@ ams of k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens have on adult animals .
to her surprise , the Mi@@ ster also did not let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved immediately in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ ens at the sight of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of caus@@ tics who , in great need , choose how scientists have found out about the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ sting of less and strongly excited young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams differs with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the livestock hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a calling of little ones , taken from the throw @-@ box for three minutes and separated from mother and brothers .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited tom@@ bs , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who have no own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop@@ e with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted anyway , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noise several times in humans .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ du@@ ann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ße is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ße .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ eling of the Arch@@ mage between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul about the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even in the case of the state of emergency after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who are responsible for the coup attempt .
it is also not done in front of football .
the prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ ße .
according to this , the South Coast currently living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ße is said to be a suppor@@ ter of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed at first for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , it has no effect on the lives of the Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for finishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be particularly well received on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season was a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion for the record master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the inau@@ g@@ ural K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; go out early in the Europa League as well .
in the Southern Li@@ g it was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the base for the 14th title with 26 seasonal buff@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g Tor@@ protective ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez , which was under contract under contract and announced to Bes@@ ik@@ tas , after the attempted coup attempt , had not returned because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Princip@@ al Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do this , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to for@@ ego around one @-@ third of his estimated annual income , Or@@ man stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the theme of D@@ oping is still the head@@ lines for the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who compla@@ ined about her start right before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , ki@@ cked off and ki@@ cked off at her start ( 100 meters breast ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a super@@ imposed smile she was still standing in the hall and provoked her performance .
when it was determined that she would not fetch gold , the audience broke out into a rush @-@ storm .
but there are still many more sports@@ men who go to the start despite the D@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked for two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion has been running even faster than before . he is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit down for six months after taking the pain@@ killer of Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery I had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the Olympic champion from 2012 , world champion from 2013 and European Championship , was tested positive for the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the alleged sei@@ z@@ ure and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favourite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and twice world champion above 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and has been locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , regre@@ t@@ ted Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , White Russia ) : hardly any athlete had so many med@@ als subsequently recognized .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his world championship title from 2005 nine years later , after he was noticed testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to give Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games on the basis of a verdict of the International Sports Court .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and gold favorite was first tested in May , but is still allowed to start in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion found indications of taking a banned nutritional supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and expi@@ red on July 13 .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she planned her return journey for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as Mu@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another human being killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
during the det@@ on@@ ation close to the popular beach area of Pat@@ ong popular with holi@@ day@@ makers , a taxi driver was injured after police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , some det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast demanded several wounded .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning from journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the act of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid .
the authorities have received intelligence evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country over the past few days - but they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
the police showed their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the mine explosion explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environ@@ s .
after clas@@ hes between security forces and Muslim populations , trips to these provinces will not be taken into account .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution established by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody ri@@ ots , re@@ port@@ edly serves to restore the Kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office of Constitutional Compla@@ int . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several assass@@ inations , the constitu@@ ents in the Con@@ federation included the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German press agency Hans @-@ Georg I ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are in extrem@@ ist ways diff@@ used .
that is why we are observing the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional advoc@@ ates in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely coordinated with the state officials during the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general extre@@ mi@@ sts try to pron@@ ounce them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the acts of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a num@@ erical advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda aims to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there were reports on the contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
Ma@@ ate said that he didn &apos;t have any knowledge about that .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - is extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the marked increase in right @-@ sm@@ elling off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would not speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be justi@@ fiable structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler Group .
it may well be that further justi@@ fiable group@@ ings or small groups are formed that plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups arose at the regional level or in social networks .
they expressed concern about the fact that many attacks on the account of people who previously did not appear in the right scene were concerned .
this is wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects suspected of attacks on asylum seekers were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have politically in@@ different or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or left who then radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records are not always determining the head@@ lines for the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous show of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Centre , the slightly overweight floating swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that at times it was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently converted into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
because most athletes are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity belly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only started with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ meter Fre@@ estyle , played no role here .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the performance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to travel alone over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
at that time M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before Olympia for eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30@@ pm and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
when she returned the next morning at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier .
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp sees the im@@ pending electoral defeat not as close as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at a campaign event in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential elections in November , it would be quite irrelevant : &quot; ultimately it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV broad@@ caster CN@@ BC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus he called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
more and more resistance was formed within his party .
post Incre@@ ases Trading with Electric Transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously large .
the post plans to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
soon the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the Post aims to offer its electric transpor@@ ters in the open market as of the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter third parties in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they are to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , even to other farms .
post @-@ Management Board Ju@@ er@@ gen Ger@@ der had said that there are always questions about professional tra@@ des@@ men .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly .
in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des had announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we are changing the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ K leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the rel@@ ap@@ ses suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of managing director Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more in@@ secure the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the forefront of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the corporate governance , the world &apos;s number five is facing a new beginning of personnel .
GF@@ K executive director plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
as of September 1 , the leadership of the Management Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is supposed to officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for details , a spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to mention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to become a market research company in future , it is unclear at this point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in An@@ le@@ en &apos;s circles it was on Friday , at the shareholders , the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the most recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become uns@@ ett@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it were the case with BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company did not have the chance to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , revenue was 6.1 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
at 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros , sales in the first half of the year declined by 3.4 percent .
earnings in the second quarter , above all , have bur@@ dened the company &apos;s sun@@ ken value in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company value depreciation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , gave the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated consolidated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in grave horns in tren@@ ches : eight injured
eight people were injured in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ n ( District of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the det@@ ain@@ ees suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her figures , had to ev@@ ade an opposite vice , which drove partly on the counter @-@ track .
the bus stopped right off the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances arrived at the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the last travelers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ torium district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of wastewater amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh Number 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the wastewater treatment fee will be increased by the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a stag@@ gering calculation , the wastewater price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the household by the district office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ cover is running for these sewage plants .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems in a cost @-@ effective manner .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as industrial and industrial companies from the region of the world , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the rates of charges lie between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt displayed the panel , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , even sur@@ geri@@ es or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period are to be compensated .
Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities in all three sewage plants with a very low waste water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , due to its age renovation and repair expendi@@ tures , rehabilitation and repair expendi@@ tures were incurred in a considerable scale in all three plants in the previous calculation period .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for pupp@@ y , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of damage in the wastewater treatment plant in Az@@ endorf .
in the pump factory Wel@@ sh , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and , after almost 20 years of operation , the first clari@@ fier had to be extended , the sewage slu@@ dge was disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility had to be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this extraordinary expenses resulted in continued assistance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that the expendi@@ tures for the operation and maintenance in the three plants were fully penet@@ rated .
according to Schmidt , the market community has been spar@@ ed great entertainment costs for the waste water systems over the past 20 years .
the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the view of stone houses , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater utility association cannot be extended because of its lack of facilities .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July inflation amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a rise in prices for the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
the prices remained as in previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; snapshot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by Ani@@ me , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with its filtering tool , it allows snap@@ shots around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absurd .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure out of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ plu@@ gged , self @-@ rotating tools that produce more than 30 million better sel@@ fies per day .
all absen@@ ces are sent to the public .
snap@@ shots have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of using Black@@ face Pro@@ mot@@ ing or White Skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week struck a filter for some users who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and wo@@ unding che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow haw@@ k . &quot;
they asked themselves whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and the ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports by The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it had disabled the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others declined the anim@@ e @-@ comparison deci@@ de@@ dly .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely used to say that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and saying annoying . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yellow face has been drawn into the depreci@@ ating extreme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; snap@@ shots is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensi@@ bility .
when one of the Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that lightning @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday , he refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel officer focusing on sub@@ merged population groups and internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said she will have her Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &apos; .
military leadership for@@ fei@@ ting IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects Congress of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were permitted on the spot , an investig@@ ative committee of the Congress registered in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the army committees , intelligence committees and military budget@@ ary comments , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , briefly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence gathering intelligence , typically un@@ riv@@ alled by high @-@ level Cent@@ com Com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; declared Ken Cal@@ vert , a Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the manag@@ erial errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct reference to the fact that government peaks have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements before the congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com An@@ ita publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the threat posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force in their lives after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway through the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense .
the democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com has created an over@@ ly limited process for creating intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; embarrass@@ ed the moral of analy@@ st and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no indication of any intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts at times have quite diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations carried out re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alle@@ gations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes over more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the former government under George W. Bush envis@@ aged only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team determined that contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries would have put oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger instruction , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US won fourth match in the women &apos;s field @-@ hockey , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before
one day after shooting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American campaign team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are the same in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , which will remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed person will go a little longer to the strong Dutch who lead the other group .
whatever the game looks like on Saturday , the Americans have caused a surprising fuss by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 squares .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey bat in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Champion of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began turning things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have completely torn the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a back stop from the near area .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the door to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
amidst the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inevitable , a ra@@ ging relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the cross@@ bow to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ verk@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ na@@ sts or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline gymnas@@ tics .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if I have mo@@ dest@@ ly arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline bed has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many of them , I had inter@@ viewed , did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never @-@ to @-@ end collision - but also the Gra@@ zie of Turn@@ - and Tau@@ ern , the two sports that essentially unite .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as a spring@@ board .
asp@@ iring winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ ts ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram , you will be rated according to the design , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio against each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to go forward in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes sometimes and back , up and down on the playground .
they don &apos;t just hunt the finish line or the starting screen , but also in television transmission another high goal : that of the world or the Olympic Committee .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a viewer to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel a bit ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the V@@ ector of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant abolition of time and gravity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as Zen as the competition can only be with the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the monkey and the obj@@ ec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US gym@@ n@@ ast recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its new fan base .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters demanding political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ men .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests erup@@ ted against the government and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s response was un@@ merciful according to human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses indicated that polic@@ emen shot and killed ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circulating videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security officers strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , while dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options aside from prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ la , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of parliament .
at the same time , tensions escal@@ ate along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who have been forced to take advantage of turbul@@ ence over the past few years , will be able to arm and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness are now explo@@ ding after years of t@@ ink@@ ering under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services have improved .
even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially with protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians thought that they assembled themselves as protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economics as they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ house Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ y@@ headed by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ra , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and is dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 .
he was considered as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say he was particularly well vers@@ ed in taking early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Nor@@ e@@ thiop@@ ia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ra .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il was 2005 after thousands protest against elections which , according to analysts , were apparently fu@@ cked by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and for their measurable progress in comb@@ ating poverty .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ gi@@ vings of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes on a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a city of Surin@@ am , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media .
analysts predict that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although it has recently concluded that it has closed this base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declared his claim Obama had set IS@@ IS to be &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by attacking that his multiple asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings its fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to declare declarations he could not have meant at all .
after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp held back to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp intended to weak@@ en the statement somewhat by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down on Mr. Tru@@ mp while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to declining demand .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this topic again .
using Twitter he warned that Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of July he strongly critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; naturally , I said that sar@@ c@@ astically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates .
but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp accepted an even more corro@@ sive tone as his survey data have gone further .
a recent survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ to @-@ head racing in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humour .
but while reinfor@@ cing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ atively his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements if Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back banks , completely wrong , and so it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out by being under control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of carrying on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide funds for a new external office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , talked a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old club .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are shri@@ mps like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural @-@ riding dishes .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed away by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the verb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gave up coffee drinking a while , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was coffee and culture in the club that pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to a quarter after seven days , every day , like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and pick up new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still receives his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap shop had taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit her soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice shop would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ boiled coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee seemed like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing meal of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abundant meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined serving of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Tur@@ tle Sou@@ p Sou@@ p .
its menu on this day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a pl@@ um pu@@ dding as a dessert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people suffering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks were told in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per publishing house illustrates the history of American cuisine during Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop , a small , local snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with potato pu@@ ree and vegetable mixture .
when the re@@ porter smoked min@@ ced meat , this found the couple suitable for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper prepared by the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have taken place in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the roads with which the country changed with it no longer to be the Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for Americans became a central issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious dishes such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods that could recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers &quot; as coo@@ ks could hide non @-@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury .
strange mixtures were tried as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious grati@@ fication took preced@@ ence over taste or even common sense .
while resear@@ ching the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man continues to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drove the habits of the country like this .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , she encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeping women &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ as such as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ Cake @-@ Food pose , are tasty .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa rural @-@ house kitchen of his kitchen , he served as the million @-@ million heavy man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the An@@ heu@@ r of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country reg@@ ained its legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
in writing the book , the couple had better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag @-@ incident .
after the plates were disp@@ elled at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and co@@ ffe made a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which served as President Roos@@ ev@@ elt at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone was reluct@@ ant to take a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E got a punch three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed during bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he used his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a group of civilians who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives to the game in order to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian guar@@ dian , showing him out of the ruins of a house during an 11 @-@ hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a lumin@@ ous symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
a rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
after an investigation on board of the S@@ anna research vessel , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland has only 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it counts , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein writes on the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed long that Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks will become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers have little knowledge about the lifestyle of Greenland sh@@ arks .
their slow motion was , as they used to equip six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
loo@@ t still make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , tor@@ ing down from higher water layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , the carbon @-@ 14 method analysed the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins they contain are no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular core .
its birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear dis@@ armament attempts to drag greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers of length , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us , on the other hand , had a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons trying to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
on the other hand , all larger Greenland sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their l@@ enti@@ cular core , which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign length an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the increase obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no accident that such meth@@ ot@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bacon at the neck a 120 year old har@@ poon tip was stuck , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on fuel @-@ flame .
they later mature - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
in the recent session , the Municipal Council has focused mainly on issues related to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Panel posted the announcement of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of newly designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ er@@ ation and registration questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications for surve@@ ying could be made , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; street lane &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - Building section 1 ) is nothing more in the way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the areas of construction in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau attract young families and former sen@@ iors .
as it was said , volunteers can report to the town hall right away , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting .
in order to be able to meet requests for res@@ ett@@ lement of other businesses connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided not to change the land use plan created in the spring of this year .
in the Unter@@ zeit@@ gesetz area , the area already declared there is extended by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
according to this , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary policies should continue to operate from London through financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , approval in the UK is enough for the so @-@ called EU passport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the benefit of large US banks .
several banks have already announced that they are reloc@@ ating jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs at the River Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the biggest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk department ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , though , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector , it is just as much sl@@ apped in infrastructure as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
furthermore , the city has easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked seventh , Luxembourg on place 19 , Dublin on place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concluded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said economic researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc might claim the reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ of@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge exposed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jur@@ ism and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was raised on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to the year 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claimed each other and took possession of laboratory work that admitted Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops backed by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
after the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried within the city , the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently comb@@ ing the city .
they delivered over 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , distributed Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters who was al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out cleaning jobs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 Clinton donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idents , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations for the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Kaiser continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations even though they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter in terms of the release of the democr@@ ats &quot; presidential candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp special advisor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the control tests were not completed .
Tru@@ mp critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business and various other links , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already collap@@ sed on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , calling on high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp paid no or only very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , indicating that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million have a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial Con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tru@@ mp for a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to an I@@ RS tax check and Tru@@ mp have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s Camp@@ a@@ ign has released tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , were on average an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the Clin@@ tons tax return from 2015 showed that they only received USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , out of which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ci@@ li@@ pu@@ ds , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ anian Ele@@ ph@@ ants
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ci@@ lia .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea already years ago , intensified its support together with US conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is a world phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , although they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without harm to the eleph@@ ants , &quot; commented the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , the end of which is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spreads fine dust to the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to chase the elephant .
a last possibility is a laun@@ cher that shoots a gold @-@ dre@@ dged fire@@ works in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no ki@@ osk construction at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of traders with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and are taking place - at the same time , the retail sector in the core city is considered to be clearly exp@@ and@@ able .
the City Council , however , now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the construction of a sales ki@@ osk on the Rhine bank near the Rhine bank which was currently under construction .
&quot; basically we welcome new business drivers , but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine bank , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction .
Jewish director sh@@ attered Berlin hotel because Israeli code was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel &apos;s pre @-@ election , as there were Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the list of the hotels .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be ph@@ oned directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a deliberate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cited by the cl@@ er@@ k of Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet , in which people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arabic guests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the alleged demands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and ap@@ ologi@@ ze &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct assignment &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has been added .
police op@@ poses tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in Sa@@ o Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber stories against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the fact that the police used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the protest participants were able to spray Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts against the temporary president Michel Tim@@ er on walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went on the streets to support the suspended president , Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison between Moscow and Teher@@ an .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest on the part of Russian companies has grown strongly in businesses in the country , shared the ambassador with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian companies accept existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 per cent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan dates from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian delegation visited some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily Pas@@ sen@@ za , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses sought : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack has been carried out on Thursday evening on the Be@@ we XXL drink market at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a gun weapon , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces were demanding the release of cash from the staff of the beverage market and subsequently fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver coloured VW Golf .
the police did not share how much money was captured .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible directly from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the incident , the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel car park in front of the par@@ ked car park with the silver colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( around 19.@@ 45 ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y of prey , should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer free time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social education day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ egi@@ vers on their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet leisure theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the first school holiday week .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on their way to Freiburg on a four day pilgri@@ m &apos;s walk .
four stages were carried out together .
in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ ance journey of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in the next two years , the District Church round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a several @-@ day pilgri@@ m &apos;s hike .
various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges have been tested and one finally decided for the bishop &apos;s town of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and informed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges .
from Hor@@ b he went by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman standing and so the pilgri@@ m &apos;s way from Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a brief impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way the Min@@ is went to field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song of specially assembled Pil@@ gri@@ m song .
for the overnight stays the parish church of the local par@@ ishes was available .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller took care of the stage targets for a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast .
on the second day Fur@@ tw@@ angen moved to Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day .
the next day we took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , but had to descend to 500 metres altitude in the heat of the Rin@@ se heat and then climbed up again afterwards .
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the lake in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here .
in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is received by the pilgri@@ m &apos;s destination was greeted by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ks home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ged last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to his own .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the railway world championships in London despite the resignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in good time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retired created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner scored an Olympic ch@@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ des was just behind , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear in order to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped out Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we have set up an Olympic ch@@ ord in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the train .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a domin@@ ating victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the platform like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successfully five days in the velo@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ kel W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race .
they reached the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he was argu@@ ing with commission@@ ers before the qualification as officials called him to measure his body size .
Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand@@ ler , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 are in the corresponding women &apos;s competition .
the UK team relies on its strong train bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a flock of med@@ als .
following a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
drama plays in the background , so Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s resignation last April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mos@@ ob@@ bling and the retirement of magn@@ itu@@ des like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .
future of Port@@ land melt @-@ up due to the removal of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium sm@@ elter from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ishes all delivery contracts , as the supplying energy company has announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria beginning of this year to not award any further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy set for 20 years is scheduled to exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs at the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , since the melting file consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently as a result of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sm@@ elter with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L believes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for power through the melt , &quot; said the company .
AG@@ L further said that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects that the Tre@@ aties will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier of electricity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L informed that the value of the contracts was already depreci@@ ated in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in anticip@@ ation of termination .
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; ability to operate the melt , or to ensure that the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting is not impaired . &quot;
the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang that would have entered into force in 2010 , even if there is yet another explanation as to why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts per year to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ress and Mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ée Lau@@ der and ran to fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , sp@@ illed reality video showing the entire kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic twist : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the whi@@ m@@ sy action of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a broadcast spot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as for the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( aut fashi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ zer 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine se@@ ep through before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there were more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; models &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the little chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the world of fashion has always been somewhat ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ oes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were boiling high again when the news came out with the appearing J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but to go around on the mis@@ fortune seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is shown in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
congreg@@ ational centres yearly have 160@@ ,000 people
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxili@@ aries are rejected annually by the municipal authorities , while the sector is preparing for the impact of further mid @-@ short transactions on already over@@ bur@@ dened transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already exc@@ essively stretched , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s Joint Criminal Centers said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only become worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people of important services you need will be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need .
the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift up these cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign indic@@ ted after workers allegedly drew fire@@ arm
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina sent a fire@@ arm to a staff in February while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software progra@@ mmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right finger on the trigger , and strai@@ gh@@ tened the run in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; he gave in his accus@@ ation .
after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the charges are only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and weapon friends - should take action if his rival was elected H@@ illary Clinton and appointed judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not push for violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and by Philip due to bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp press spokesperson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not to be reached for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip beat out as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls at his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses are recorded for the SPD and CD@@ U parties .
this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could scarcely be ruled out , this is not possible after the poll@@ s in Berlin .
in both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party just smil@@ ed just before the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 percent again .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would rise to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite light losses , the Green Party hes@@ itated by 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
the N@@ PD and the F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the poll@@ s , the poll@@ s accounted for only 23 per cent of the poll@@ s in Berlin ( Ele@@ ction 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they were thus still behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
with 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the department store for the first time .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would , in contrast to 2011 , miss the entrance .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors are domin@@ ating the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogra@@ m and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was pretty cum@@ ber@@ some .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would range for about two sel@@ fies at high resolution today .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; came to businesses exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet portal .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could have a lot for that standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , albeit slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was pretty proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 euros .
the average sales price for a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the start of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; cell phone business experienced unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , the market is dominated by providers who all came much later than Nokia .
being online anywhere and everywhere today is everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment are around € 400 billion .
this is due to the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator to easily serve everything by touch screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Apple &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triumph@@ al march &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; began , still today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
after all , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
today , every German is viewing his cell phone 88 times a day .
&quot; we all have to learn to get rid of the Smartphone , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for staff in the Siemens executive board .
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring about renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction in He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics took great advantage for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ aged on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ellers were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 bn in swe@@ at@@ y growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave both the airport and the whole UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal .
now they are ready to provide a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Game &quot; regarding ad blocking
according to one of the software manufacturers , companies who earn money using online advertising make attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block scor@@ ing marks on his desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it told users that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop site would change the code for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect indicating the part of the advertisements on which part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth struggle is underway between the time @-@ consuming Open Source Community and the det@@ ers since the invention of ad blo@@ wers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has been involved in the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ bra@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company has opted for ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker .
advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a large amount of revenue , so Facebook is the investment of such a step as re@@ warding .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; Ad Pre@@ fer@@ encing tool &quot; to give people more control over it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail communication .
ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we instead focused on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss Highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling for witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a presum@@ ed suicide of several cars .
the incident occurred near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , wanted to kill himself by several vehicles , including a truck , himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , who asks them and every witnesses of the incident to report .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the past five years show that the drivers are not accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases , where a person was running in the dark on the free@@ way , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that pedestri@@ ans run on the highway in the middle of the night , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent murder after crossing a man and killed a man who was lying near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took up the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who had responded to an emergency call -- in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhabited
the Venus was probably once inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have rejected similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly progres@@ sed .
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably rejected more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus highlights its day @-@ to @-@ day side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution that had previously been suspected of planet researchers .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over billions of years - was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen left , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy re@@ joined the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che as a trainer and vice president of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday and led to a low co @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
during the summer , I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contribution to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we value all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy was awarded the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he took the club to 112 points and to the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs from Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post @-@ season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , set strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles on the remuneration for North @-@ sea workers are suspended , while all the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sit down for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop several full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , which will begin next year in order to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contracting companies in the North Sea by some 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rate shor@@ tening follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said additional cuts will give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament committee , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes ever held in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are anticipated for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in star @-@ pile to different rates , and in what context the rotation periods are associated with planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the Earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which were originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogn@@ ising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up with their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper articles about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to both , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant in the Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back with performance for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he created the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the hall of fame of the bas@@ eball .
for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 forbidden ster@@ oids to be taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received performance @-@ promoting agents through an anti @-@ aging clinic for years .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could have done me a favour for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time sweet@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games still get the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and gave the relations with pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympathy and con@@ fes@@ sions of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : little X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a wi@@ ped athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swimming @-@ player Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions these news are coming to the end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court , CA@@ S , confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses over 50 m of Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
likewise in the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa was le@@ aking through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said that the banned substance is the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended for the time being suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v informed himself immediately with criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny taking , but they are not allowed to run in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Federation IA@@ AF for@@ ba@@ de the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , and the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming sport , the earlier depar@@ tures in China also caused serious disputes between the athletes .
for example , the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to pass over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested positive for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ ac@@ azi@@ de in the Chinese Championships in 2014 , but had to sit only a three month lock .
data lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ ecting hack@@ ers her ran@@ som
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , partly victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of the companies were already aiming for a ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som sal@@ ts demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially resulting ran@@ som will be considerably higher than in private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a frigh@@ tening fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most of the art programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files en@@ code the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail@@ ers .
in order to get the final encryption code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where private users find the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is still stand@@ still .
the damage is therefore higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 percent of the German companies affected reported losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the hack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and came to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their cas@@ u@@ alties by chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , em@@ bed freely accessible support websites or deci@@ ph@@ er free sample files for free .
and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate sometimes hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share their work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
the previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers then seek further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
thus , one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment takes place per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known for many companies that better protect their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if encryption of data is not an adequate threat to successful testing , the perpetr@@ ators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means that the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in future , the perpetr@@ ators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz of Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such blocked heating could certainly be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory rather than the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda will pack everything in the little HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work tight in any place .
the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the top of the cockpit is falling down .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage .
there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l for raised back@@ rests and 10@@ 26 l for folded back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded up like a chin @-@ up chair and offer storage space , which is height 1.@@ 24 m high from floor to ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the load height is 650 mm a little higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm at wide speed ranges .
but he is likely to do his job somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is grati@@ fying .
there is another engine mechan@@ ization : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering should be a little more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and lane keeping assistant .
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control responds to road sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tle speed when required .
full connectivity , however , is only available for top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel of 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is conceivable only in the case of dangers , which are typical of air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee cap during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life , the judgment .
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
after their trip , sick leave only receive money if the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ lessly found in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the negotiated case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vomiting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il .
she spent almost all the vacation in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective treatment plant that was supposed to have polluted sea water .
the family had the opinion that the trip had been defici@@ ent - and compla@@ ined against the organizer .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the plain@@ ti@@ ff was defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it before leaving the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his obligation to inform , so judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly caused by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , after the violent acts perpet@@ rated by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been worried about further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber and resol@@ ute at the same time to react to terrorist threats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if convic@@ ts have to leave the country more quickly , they increase the security and strengthen the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior clear himself against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear@@ thing for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship previously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a general ban on full @-@ wear does not pose a problem for the Constitution .
you can &apos;t ban everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .

better traffic flow on the motorway
it th@@ aw@@ s regularly on the stra@@ pping road - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is to change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal ab@@ ort shall be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the environmental road every evening in traffic jam , when they drive over the highway nearby Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) between Hammer Straße and the De@@ par@@ ture Wes@@ er Straße in the right lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then pass directly from the Hammer Straße to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic cle@@ ars early on , whereby the overall process is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the train tracks on the feeder anno@@ y drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes beyond .
reason is the needle @-@ cave on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler street .
from here , traffic is only tra@@ vers@@ ed by the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations have resulted in the bridge not having the necessary load capacity to absorb heavy @-@ duty traffic in two lanes .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the inter@@ connected traffic con@@ ges@@ tion will last , the competent regional operation cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining useful life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal ab@@ bey estate , the state company deliberately chose the traffic weaker time in the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities .
the traffic is passed on on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of forest school visited the theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a musical project .
N@@ ima &apos;s Association provides young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s Association , 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the Small House .
since the beginning of the year the association , which aims to integrate young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most young people of the class came to Mu@@ en@@ ster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , according to the press release of the boy theatre Münster .
N@@ ima &apos;s association , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from language , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December young people with and without a migration and migration background will be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle of heaven , said the chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many stars in the sky .
the star @-@ scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest con@@ stell@@ ations .
they have their names because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips to sleep disorders
in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning it &apos;s not possible to think of sleep well before the alarm bells .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not rest@@ ful .
what are sleeping problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons for them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eder , member of the board of the German Society for Di@@ alogue and S@@ leep Medicine .
what you understand for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a single and sleeping disorder .
especially sleeping can be seen as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the Executive Board of the German House Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
in@@ frequently , the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking is common especially for depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are dependent on each other .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disk failure , you can sleep well , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eks .
the impairment can be quite different : one is beaten , tired , ind@@ ented , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out the causes .
behavi@@ our@@ al changes include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly any resident physician in Germany , emphas@@ ised Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary S@@ leep Medicine Centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
for this reason , in case of sleeping problems , you should first contact your family doctor .
this can be clari@@ fied with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the slaugh@@ ter@@ house , and what happens ?
for example , in the sleep lab , doctors advise doctors in snor@@ ing with breathing problems , abnormal daily fatigue , sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers or if the cause of a sleeping disorder is not found , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should normally spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera draws the sleeping @-@ ends on the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for better sleep .
it counts on : regular bed and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not watch at night at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook about dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he first took gold at the Doh@@ a &apos;s short @-@ term World Championships and at the same time presented his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself against his ex @-@ team colleagues who are standing in criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king 150@@ ,000 € should not be surprised by missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page .
the pumping system in the swimming sport is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
with this we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote very much and do not look closely or even run it on the topic of dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how it should be with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of baggage det@@ ained
professional thi@@ eves at the Düsseldorf airport
on Thursday , civilian victims of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage theft as a gang .
at 9 : 30 p.m. , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport picked up a band that was known to the police from past anti @-@ theft off@@ ences .
since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences and participated in a collaborative , working and particularly professional manner .
the Speci@@ alists of the Det@@ ective In@@ spec@@ tor 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves , which have been specially handed over to Germany for criminal off@@ ences .
in total , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between yet another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like that , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the road from east to west , you pass play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone spra@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a gray house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be preferred in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the inhabitants have rented le@@ ases , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has been calling for a tough action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after clearing up the rooms on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers on 22 June , the police pat@@ rolled out official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , closed off parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners , the building workers were renov@@ ating the rooms .
on 13 July a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the evi@@ ction had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are gener@@ ously affected by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for a majority of police protection from the left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police open between home occup@@ iers and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood , which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Mainz street very near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was swept under great police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tives from around the world over the past few years : with them , residents of East Germany and former home occup@@ iers share their neighbourhood .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on thrown discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that have been pla@@ stered with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are made up of material damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
there can be no talk of uncertainty for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house near the controversial 94 for 17 years .
as for violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ lifting : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga road - and has remained .
for this reason it was also so important that the residents got back their streets : from the police , politicians and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the part of the city .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings that supp@@ ress the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not endor@@ se violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if someone never li@@ stens to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin has little understanding for the drawn @-@ out , which anno@@ y itself about color bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
anyone who draws near should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district , can complain about noise .
all persons mentioned only with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups for refugees , administration , authorities and those who are still involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there now , the vain Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less mo@@ cking rather than relying on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
an administrative professional has been sought with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just like a wo@@ ollen wool @-@ ch@@ sau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but administration work is not their central area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , it concerns organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent stake for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
new containers soon in Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time now to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the county office to the commun@@ e and job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far it doesn &apos;t work , so I &apos;m dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing line .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to a fixed housing , there are internship plac@@ ements , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help master builders , do not do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it needs offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
thus , administration and honorary officials also jump here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it takes time and makes sense to bridge time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling at some point can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problem cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers are honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who have nothing at all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always motivated to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a difficult question : did the two fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation after the latest happ@@ enings , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer clearly says &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; a residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude them .
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would put them in dis@@ credit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials need to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
in doing so , they always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the pri@@ me@@ works are already at full capacity to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
currently , these are about 100 people , mainly young men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
