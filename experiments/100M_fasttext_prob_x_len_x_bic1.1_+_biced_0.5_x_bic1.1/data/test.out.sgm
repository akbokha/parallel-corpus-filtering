<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the Sports Pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden World Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was not a good experience," "" "" "" "says Langer." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let his family run over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even shoot himself for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver bay leaf, champion tour player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already spotted him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "" "" "says Langer," "" "" "" "for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been fostering offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master champion was added to the "Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports" on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The winners include athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Giver, the former Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rowers Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadion where the Lavazza prize was running.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trump economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want to do so." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, the two U.S. presidential candidates are undivided into tax and energy policy as well as a fundamental issue." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he will massively go back to regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the other hand Clinton said:" "" "" "" "the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has opportunities to open and needs money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In that it must be invested, say Trump and Clinton almost verbatim.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump plans to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining again in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly plans to expand and demand renewables with its investment program: "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazied trade agreement, do not want to sign it.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they should be paid even better, says Clinton." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand is Trump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe him that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who wants to demand at least from the rich is that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the division manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social relief services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run.</seg>

<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance specialists have called upon their union to approve new labor disputes in relation to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more work events from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC claimed that it would have missed ministers to respond to the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance specialists and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in favour of the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was "persistently calm" to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "In view of this the JDC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and request official re-negotiations for all your concerns." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "" "" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "" "" "Alliance of outsiders" "" "" "" "?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter-player in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed slim and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if there had never been anything worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustainable coolness emanating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offense was even greater since it was committed by a putative boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the Vetter will be difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been removed from his office last month by a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "a report in VeDemsti put it as follows:" "" "" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the persistent resentment on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and lessen the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian president won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" to me as an analyst once described to me: two countries that are hurting themselves from the West and now allied themselves badly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it could be significant that after almost three hours at the press conference, both presidents express that they had not even stripped the issue." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster - when NATO member Turkey broke out the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders would at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fired up Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of Putin's strictest confidence in many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a statement by the Kremlin it is said that without stating grounds" "" "" "" "Putin ordered the dismissal of Ivanovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later was the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your work as Head of State on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and had recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are you convincing the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff retreats at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a type of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president - would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed on great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to trust complaining items for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term of office, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as Putin's third term had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering work of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, nearly 79% of the entire deck deck is on its place and the last section of the deck today finds a gong for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first shutter represents a significant milestone for every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last section of the road and its connection with the North Tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern rail bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play anymore, but rather prefer spending their free time on screens has been plagued by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, they can be "photographed" (using a screenshot on the cell phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "in the US, the game has led to a considerable increase in steps taken back by the" "" "" "" "average" "" "" "" "person every day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch who pursues 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of pursued people that train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data for performance enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take "take 30 minutes of time to" come from the sofa "and" to be active every day "push on deaf ears because many public messages are dull to health and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are thus covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also grumbling game-perks, which always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be retracted over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to poker success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="8">Brilliantly and brilliantly.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast took part in the multi-campaign title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medalists and "Final Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalists Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American female Simone Biles turns on the brim beam during the solo competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Reson told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was waiting for her last test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a last oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American female Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the solo multi-campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>

<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted that during their long way to the top, never planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion into the gym, in which Boorman trained, became the force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina slightly led through two turns, the picture was smashed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and floor urns - in which Biles holds the world title - lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the brim beam - and put on it on the floor with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her endergust - a pure formality - and tears poured out on her glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake in Mustafina.</seg>

<seg id="32">After her soil exercise, she threw kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died, who died in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-fire weapon, while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police informed that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of robbery, since the aggressor did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in hispanic homes within four months and two more were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, announced at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a bullet out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's Olympic cup in gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, the Catholicin, round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This crew finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected, but masterful Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't see turnaround in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to bring it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner primarily in private gymnastic societies that are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started working with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to enable the communities of aun countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable, easy-to-access gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turnfoundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastic in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this crew that brings thousands of young girls to interest the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by holding the olympic team gold and thanks, she motivates her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistance doctors would like to organise more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunts's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistance doctors who voted with a vote refused to reject it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt's plans revealed to forcibly introduce the treaty and said that the NHS was in a "No Man's Land" and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract containing changes to nocturnal and weekend packages, in order to improve care at unfavourable times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors, announced last night in a message: "assistance specialists have made a serious concern to the proposed agreement, in particular that it will heat up the current financial crisis and to treat it to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes by discussions prompted the government to engage in resistance and sometimes deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="10">If he did not do this, the assistant doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work events.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were included to provide medical doctors on the strike chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA aims to provide a better weekly remuneration for the 54,000 assistance doctors who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS employees, urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "labor struggle measures do not achieve anything that little, but already burden overloaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, nurses and their families only worry, distress and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of the Assistant Doctors and responded positively to the concerns about the tutelage and the whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who are returning from a professional time, training opportunities, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training vacations and the Ministry of Health in compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people suffering from heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year-long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the artery walls that form floorings.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the floorcovering breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots that clog the flow of blood to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clot detaches, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The pipeline project of NICE, published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who had already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">By a preliminary recommendation by Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness: political Correctness flourishes in Muslim territories</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year on the instigation of a government report for corruption from the office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored any evidence of abuse due to "oversensitivity regarding ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption economist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police were allowed to set off shut-off tapes outside of electoral booths to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he recommends that voters should take a reference to prove their identity in elections." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment a voter has to name only his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not only for election fraud, but should also protect the municipal government against the broader corruption and financial fraud that comes with it," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's electoral campaign in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman was to be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "Rahman is said to have led" his campaign "" "" "" "" on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of imitation in which one person as someone else chooses.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He voiced in particular alarmingly to the fraudulent letter of mail - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding ID to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof has been affixed that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, in particular women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of elders, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there were concerns that... state institutions have knowingly ignored such behavior because of" politically correct "" "" "" "" perceptions of ethnicity and religion. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activist manipulate lettering documents to stop "election harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, considered by Theresa May, also demands tougher registration checks to prevent the polling directory to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to be carried out to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit to applications for an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition states that political activists deal with full letter selections and envelopes from selections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up lockouts for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change in law that facilitated an accusation due to intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prohibition of photography in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the election stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees rule out the rule that voters go on their own in the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the electoral district has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy to corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Due to a number of reasons, he was pleaded guilty for a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "dismantling controls" of city council elections.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "Sir Eric said:" "" "" "" "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are approaching from behind, you should turn around as first so you can see your attacker and go out of the firing line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder, before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hit him with his knee into the groin and twist, while the attacker bowed before pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the gun at the same time and beat the attacker to the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller withdrew his immune system and throws of hearts to a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook off his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a purge button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the leaking of each object he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of leaking the purge button of a pull toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public rails to stations to rinsing buttons of toilets, the task posed its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he did justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial period showed a luminous figure of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after their luminous figure was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," showing the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more discernible than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick anything here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "we carried out crazy brainstorming that ended with saying that we told" "" "" "" "call us Ian." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others, in which it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia shouldn't choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Sunday election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">More stupid than so far it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and day-to-day elections - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the locals, who are to be convinced by the campaign fighters, are on vacation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems for this: during the holidays helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and vote in the end will only work hard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign just below the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his major posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as it already did his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blooming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "their refugee policy," "" "" "" "We create this" "" "" "", "accelerates the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the right time at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations; Merkel Bundestagresahlkreis is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Sachsen as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "" "" "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the north-east CDU largely renounces the usual campaign distances on marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "that," "" "" "" "Kokert," "" "" "" "plays only a" subordinate role. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has noticed that in the country you crumble the base that it has to be very hard to find a wire to people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely exists in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU electoral fighter Kokert to his fellow combatants, however, is also self-revealing: "they must go where it hurts, namely, where people are: brightest, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into parliament." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "online election campaign" "" "" "", "calls the regional leader Claudia Müller." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Apart from that, green campaigns embark on the search for local stimulators among holidaymakers.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the subject shall also be praised for the construction of those responsible for construction, for example when it comes to setting up houseboat trips." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was emigrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again consists, the traffic situation within the village was relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "citizens can now continue on both sides from Ofterdingen from the B 27." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the passing of the place seems to go back." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable discomfort," says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachelstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping routes were looking and more familiar to their Navi than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the franchisement of some trucks in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As speed limits were not complied with, the municipality also called for Mössingen's measurement vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself competent on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been injected.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was at 77 km / h in the pace-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, it has become more calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the street is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales outbreaks for them, everyone can look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some are less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are therefore produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a "maximum slight drop," but also admits that of course "the run-track is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most crowded places are the bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly a crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "not only him, but all the restaurants were" "" "" "" "hard hit" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must be happy about every Euro turnover." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "he quotes the sales losses to" "" "" "" "far above 50 percent" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the planting has been" "" "" "" "thrown back two years" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "half of his staff have to be dismissed." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would benefit from the benefits of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other districts where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">For all claims, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go down, it's also nice somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family members come back to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu, Göhner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis he has experienced in her long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="11">Following the latest proposals in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière took a little time before presenting his conclusions for the security in the Republic.</seg>

<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière is launching a second attempt on proposals that had not been made with the SPD so far: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knocking jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "" "" "said the CDU man." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still believes this to be reasonable and does not demand anything in the case of the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them have it in themselves: he is planning a quick-release process for deportations and more opportunities to incarcerate people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of suspicions for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than to date - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to mask their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of this is politically and legally delicate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some people are still unextinct and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the imbalance of patient for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people worried about safety in the face of the high number of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that profoundly employed people did not let themselves be clinging to election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved enormously into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking their position on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, between the two parties it went up high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garish argument about the equipping of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some of the interior ministers, in which the departments demand a burka ban and a return from dual citizenship.</seg>

<seg id="4">There is confusion about a term in the recall campaign.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts restrained demand in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite the diesel shareholders, Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus thanks to its many brands and some good-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the core brand VW was weakening especially in Western Europe and again charged the total sales, as the company announced in the Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand sold 44,9100 cars to 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's level.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, deliveries declined by almost a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Market sales manager Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker data from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "in addition, in some core markets," "" "" "" "changed economic conditions" "" "" "" "had a reluctance to buy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on the exit from the EU, too, explained a spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhaust gas has escalated first, a minus is also available.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected household brand of the Niedersachsen got off lightly by the diesel-scandal: after the first seven months, only one distribution minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales head Fred Kappler continued to show a sales growth from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this period, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulated by a software exhaust test.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling for some 2.5 million vehicles to retrofit into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting VW reaffirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "the car manufacturer points out a" "" "" "" "guaranteed certificate" "" "" "" "after conversion, but do not speak of a" guarantee "" "" "" "" as it was on Friday in corporate travel. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Legal entities are the reason.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Focus" "" "" "" "had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for old diesel models." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport confirms that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "VW has fully met the requirements of my enquiry commission and KBA." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "deviations from this are not accepted," "" "" "" "declared Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after retrofitting do not take place and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "warranty," but not as it was called in corporate travel.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the long term "warranty," Volkswagen can see the possibility of customers coming to a workshop for example six months after the changeover - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even in the interests of the customers, it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the scandal, there is uncertainty about possible warranty regulations, as it meant.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonesome middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section to see it under the pseudonym Non-Alleenary Men's age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reemergence of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes of hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers reserve their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and roaring wildly before I stop, hold my hands and tell something more demonic like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, the I of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dressed the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers meet the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media team, people who have heard about the comeback and can see to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their disks again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to fans of the record carnival of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores have a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "according to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted an infringement of the contactless payment system." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record sleeves, of objects that awake happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally concern yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not listened to it yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I flatten through a stack to bossa nova compilation.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't own a record player but I would like to buy a Radiohead record, so that I can put it into the shelf," he says. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-less, less music-like.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people saying," "" "" "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the record to almost an entire floor, has a blower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of newest Synthesizer- and sex@-@ packed Pop instead of experimental jazz drumming from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange but nailing psychological trauma is hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been in business for several minutes and considers the variety of records available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window bumper than a big buy-in.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not earn much, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression to muzzle the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls, who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Croce record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "it is pure" "" "" "" "panel art" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could make more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they are not taken into account at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not by strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through panels, while they steer clear of the starry view of an uncanny, 30-year-old erroneous host who hangs over the shoulders of naughty middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should have jurisdiction to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energydrinks, sell hairdresser services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which salvage a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "are absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feed people living in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>

<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the Niederreissen was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is operated generally and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a master class in handling, side steping, back, line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was won by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this Fiji would have beaten a 15-man-team in its best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for UK - but it probably won't - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former chief for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, she lost each game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and left the attacks GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running in running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau heaped up in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A belligerent torchlight of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leonean Nakarawa to score a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Veremalova went down a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still more than one minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pushed through further weak Tactics of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still seeded.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the coach to a rudder victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than with these games and that wants what's called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke up to the last 220 tough hieve that go into history Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all present when she led to the second Olympic medley in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th unplugged insert, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletics who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no one was more readily available than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risked something.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that was what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment early 2014, out of season, which kept the break to a minimum if that was the right concept in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and walked around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wrecking morning with it a little more than anything else and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, which was a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. it might be a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to finish, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not eager to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">Today we didn't want a firework, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race as we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>

<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the association is regarded as" "" "" "" "Bavarian far exemplary." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Frankish drinking water utility association as a model for large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">So it was called the Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavarian Radio) some time ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia praised the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "the work of the Veitenstein group is" "" "" "" "Bavarian far as exemplary." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zweckverband employee, stands for 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, annually promotes about 150,000 cubic meters of water and provides 32 locations and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are municipalities of Kirchner, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">For further cities and municipalities, there are water supply contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunner Mayor of Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water company in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work through office and organization activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergencies on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of the elevated tanks (1999), the re-creation of a central computer control system (2004) and the renovations of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no stalemate and I have always resumed innovations, because water is life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation, she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over the age of 31.</seg>
<seg id="18">He used a lot of lifeblood for his water-purpose association and he really lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a genuine practitioner, he was able to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate cutting in front of the Wasserforum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received very much recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised the Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water keeper and he was a loyal scarf.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the Zweckverband.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the rupture at the elevated tank near Kirchder on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">The supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained once, because it was filled with hoses from the high-rise reservoir of Pettstadt.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - light view for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the sector threatened from the green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Survey at the existing plants for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations we could finally reach." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gas from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levelling of 20 percent is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "Gabriel" "" "" "" "the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation worsened further, when the world's largest producer country China threw massive steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel conglomerates price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">During this spring, the situation somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties on import steel show effect; on the other hand, economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the end, ThyssenKrupp alone did not want to exclude closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers remain cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same period of the previous year, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the quantity produced now returned to each other for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">Thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in output in the coming months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does the seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "singing moves me - emotionally and physically," "" "" "" "she describes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good in her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says of the German seniors division.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ursel Kipp also has this experience in her choir: "to speak and to organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the pudding quickly even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "elderly people often have a very special effect," "" "" "" "says Ursula Lenz," "" "" "" "of the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senior Citizens" organisations. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people wakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers are relieved of long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors' choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who complained about her start right before the games after a doping lock, kicked off and kicked off at her start (100 meters breast).</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a whimsical scene: with a superimposed smile she was still standing in the hall and provoked her performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it was determined that she would not fetch gold, the audience broke out into a rush-storm.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are still many more sportsmen who go to the start despite the Doping past at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel / USA): the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was already locked for two times because of doping (2001 and 2006 until 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since its spell, the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex-World Champion has been running even faster than before. he is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9.80 seconds and is considered the greatest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m-m-season / Jamaika): the two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit down for six months after taking the painkiller of Oxycodon.</seg>
<seg id="15">After surgery I had severe toothache, the 29-year-old defended.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sandra Perkovic (Diskus / Croatia): 2011, the Olympic champion from 2012, world champion from 2013 and European Championship, was tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamin from 2010 to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="17">Perkovic denied the alleged seizure and was closed for six months.</seg>
<seg id="18">The four furthest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favourite.</seg>
<seg id="19">LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-relay / USA): the Beijing Olympic champion and twice world champion above 400 m, was tested positive in 2010 and has been locked for 21 months.</seg>
<seg id="20">A means of penis enlargement has been responsible, regretted Merritt.</seg>
<seg id="21">This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ivan Tichon (Hammer Throw, White Russia): hardly any athlete had so many medals subsequently recognized.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus, Tichon lost his world championship title from 2005 nine years later, after he was noticed testosterone doping.</seg>
<seg id="24">The now 40-year-old had also had to give Olympia-Silver in 2004 because of steroid-doping and the EM-title 2006 because of testosterone abuse.</seg>
<seg id="25">He also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games on the basis of a verdict of the International Sports Court.</seg>
<seg id="26">At 80.04 m he is ranked second in the world rankings.</seg>
<seg id="27">Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): the world record holder and gold favorite was first tested in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="28">The 29-year-old world champion found indications of taking a banned nutritional supplement, the lock of the world anti-doping agency WADA fell mild and expired on July 13.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian violates - Several dead</seg>
<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but have already left them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her return journey for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected Austrian citizens, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, such as Muöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">At about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was initially exploding two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutchmen and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosives went up again, and another human being killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation close to the popular beach area of Patong popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured after police instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Revier of the Coastal Police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, some detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast demanded several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the bomb attacks bear the same handwriting," "" "" "" "said army general Danai Kritmethavee, Friday morning from journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the act of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities have received intelligence evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country over the past few days - but they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police showed their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the mine explosion explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its environs.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, trips to these provinces will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution established by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody riots, reportedly serves to restore the Kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rio 2016: ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes an internethite</seg>
<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records are not always determining the headlines for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous show of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Centre, the slightly overweight floating swimmer from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that at times it was no longer visible in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was subsequently converted into a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because most athletes are running in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Soon the first nicknames made the round.</seg>

<seg id="17">His time, he only started with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter Freestyle, played no role here.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani took care of media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the performance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to travel alone over 100 metres of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim before Olympia for eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the wastewater treatment fee will be increased by the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a staggering calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the household by the district office Kulmbach, it was established that undercover is running for these sewage plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems in a cost-effective manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, citizens as well as industrial and industrial companies from the region of the world, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rates of charges lie between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt displayed the panel, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, even surgeries or undercover from the previous calculation period are to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities in all three sewage plants with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to its age renovation and repair expenditures, rehabilitation and repair expenditures were incurred in a considerable scale in all three plants in the previous calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for puppy, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of damage in the wastewater treatment plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pump factory Welsh, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and, after almost 20 years of operation, the first clarifier had to be extended, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility had to be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "Schmidt:" "" "" "" "this extraordinary expenses resulted in continued assistance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that the expenditures for the operation and maintenance in the three plants were fully penetrated.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to Schmidt, the market community has been spared great entertainment costs for the waste water systems over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the above-mentioned facilities will continue to be precarious in the view of stone houses, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater utility association cannot be extended because of its lack of facilities.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "snapchat says that this filter is inspired by Anime, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, it allows snapshots around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unplugged, self-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million better selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All absences are sent to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapshots have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of using Blackface Promoting or White Skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week struck a filter for some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and wounding cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow hawk."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves whether these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it had disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the anime-comparison decidedly.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely used to say that the filter was "hurting and saying annoying."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the depreciating extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "snapshots is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolper" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of the Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that lightning-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left snapchat unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, he refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel officer focusing on submerged population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership forfeiting ISIS intelligence, rejects Congress of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic view of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were permitted on the spot, an investigative committee of the Congress registered in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the army committees, intelligence committees and military budgetary comments, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering intelligence, typically unrivalled by high-level Centcom Commanders, regularly recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," declared Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The managerial errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct reference to the fact that government peaks have given instructions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, comments and statements before the congress were much more positive than the facts" "" "" "" "presented the report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom Anita publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tips of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force in their lives after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway through the General Inspector of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">The democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, the Centcom has created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this process," "" "" "" "Mr Schiff," "" "" "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "" "" "embarrassed the moral of analyst and" "" "" "" "gave too little space for deviating opinions." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication of any intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts regarding a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector, after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts at times have quite diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations carried out repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes over more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the former government under George W. Bush envisaged only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team determined that contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries would have put oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger instruction, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inevitable, a raging relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the crossbow to the swimmers to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leverky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modestly arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline bed has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparse the last 16 years that many of them, I had interviewed, did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never-to-end collision - but also the Grazie of Turn- and Tauern, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as a springboard.</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, pike and salts) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "according to the official Olympiaprogram, you will be rated according to the design, difficulty and" "" "" "" "flight time" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go forward in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes sometimes and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They don't just hunt the finish line or the starting screen, but also in television transmission another high goal: that of the world or the Olympic Committee.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel a bit tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vector of the Trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as Zen as the competition can only be with the Olympic Games." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the monkey and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US gymnast recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits its new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long is an ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters demanding political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at gunmen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests erupted against the government and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the government's response was unmerciful according to human rights organisations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses indicated that policemen shot and killed umpteen unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security officers strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for a thorough investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, while dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you oppress people and have no other options aside from protesting, it breaks out," "" "" "" "said Seyoum Tesla, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions escalate along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been forced to take advantage of turbulence over the past few years, will be able to arm and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of tinkering under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services have improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially with protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians thought that they assembled themselves as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economics as they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under one umbrella," "" "" "" "said Mulhouse Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairyheaded by members of the ethnic group of Tigra, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and is dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was a 17-year-old Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly well versed in taking early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Norethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigra.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil was 2005 after thousands protest against elections which, according to analysts, were apparently fucked by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misgivings of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes on a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city of Surinam, attacked by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts predict that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although it has recently concluded that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "" "" "Mr Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he strongly criticised himself when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "naturally, I said that sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "according to how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump accepted an even more corrosive tone as his survey data have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A recent survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and head-to-head racing in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while reinforcing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocatively his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, gave a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "" "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about Mr. Trump's statements if Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back banks, completely wrong, and so it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread out by being under control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of carrying on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "he ridiculed the" "" "" "" "poor, miserable" "" "" "" "TV experts trying to understand him and said," "" "" "" "You can't!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as only a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenpoint's Café entered the market once over the price.</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a skinny café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices came from his Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie shop, which opened in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indigenous people considered it the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel exempt and verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it's also re-invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide funds for a new external office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, talked a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old club.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are shrimps like capers and sauced onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural-riding dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many old customers were also pushed away by prices from Williamsburg," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>

<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came to a quarter after seven days, every day, like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and pick up new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal still receives his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he had no resentment that the soap shop had taken the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think we will go into their offer," "" "" "" "Rodriguez said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants Greenpoints also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he has prepared to exhibit her soon, so that his new neighbours feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has further advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice shop would like to fill and sell the cold-boiled coffee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee seemed like a homecoming.</seg>

<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for many years, became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried as a calorie-rich and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even common sense.</seg>

<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country regained its legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Brickman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">A rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation on board of the Sanna research vessel, this shark was allowed to return to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it counts, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein writes on the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist presumed long that Greenland's sharks will become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have little knowledge about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion was, as they used to equip six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cadavers, toring down from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, the carbon-14 method analysed the lenticular nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins they contain are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lenticular core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear disarmament attempts to drag greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters of length, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, had a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons trying to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lenticular core, which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter-long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign length an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the increase obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no accident that such methotalemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck a 120 year old harpoon tip was stuck, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on fuel-flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">They later mature - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible early as possible," "" "" "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Four stages were carried out together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next Romance journey of all the registrants in the next two years, the District Church round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a several-day pilgrim's hike.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimages have been tested and one finally decided for the bishop's town of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruene, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor Storost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and informed the pilgrimages.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb he went by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer loved woman standing and so the pilgrim's way from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a brief impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way the Minis went to field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song of specially assembled Pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays the parish church of the local parishes was available.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller took care of the stage targets for a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day Furtwangen moved to Gütenbach on the second day.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day we took the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting route, but had to descend to 500 metres altitude in the heat of the Rinse heat and then climbed up again afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the lake in the evening.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raged last night in the men's team sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made to his own.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the railway world championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner scored an Olympic chord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hindes was just behind, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear in order to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped out Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed to the podium.</seg>

<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 at the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>

<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>

<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successfully five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brakel Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They reached the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he was arguing with commissioners before the qualification as officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Despite, Joanna Rowel Shandler, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260 are in the corresponding women's competition.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong train bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a flock of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">Following a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama plays in the background, so Shane Sutton's resignation last April in the midst of sexism and mosobbling and the retirement of magnitudes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium smelter from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby abolishes all delivery contracts, as the supplying energy company has announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria beginning of this year to not award any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>

<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, since the melting file consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa completed the Point Henry Schmelzer, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently as a result of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL believes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for power through the melt," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL further said that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions," which should have entered into force in November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month period of notice, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "therefore, AGL expects that the Treaties will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," "" "" "" "said the supplier of electricity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 is currently limited by forecasts of strong futures for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL informed that the value of the contracts was already depreciated in the amount of $187 million in anticipation of termination.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just a kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Managress and Mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estée Lauder and ran to fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry" "" "" "", "Kendall wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians like?), spilled reality video showing the entire kardashian-Jenner family (except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the whimsy action of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought that we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a broadcast spot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, certainly a new era of cardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as for the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (aut fashionista were from the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine seep through before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years there were more "celebrities," models "models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenner's position in the world of fashion has always been somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistletoes of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling high again when the news came out with the appearing Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to go around on the misfortune seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is shown in reality TV. probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) considerable losses are recorded for the SPD and CDU parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the north could scarcely be ruled out, this is not possible after the polls in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD collapsed from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party just smiled just before the CDU, which could rise to 23 percent again.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is contested between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would rise to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite light losses, the Green Party hesitated by 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent) to Schwerin Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">The NPD and the FDP were not represented in the Landtag with 3 per cent respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the polls, the polls accounted for only 23 per cent of the polls in Berlin (Election 2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">They were thus still behind the green with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors are dominating the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would range for about two selfies at high resolution today.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 communicator" came to businesses exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euros, lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet portal.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could have a lot for that standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, albeit slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was pretty proud: 2700 D-Mark, that is about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price for a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would be the start of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns' cell phone business experienced unprecedented disaster, eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market is dominated by providers who all came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being online anywhere and everywhere today is everyday life for a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million units alone.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the equipment are around €400 billion.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is due to the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the meantime, a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhones at the Mac-World.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator to easily serve everything by touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the Apple" "" "" "" "triumphal march" "" "" "" "began, still today the iPhone is the Group's most important product." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had a look.</seg>
<seg id="35">After all, they disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The saws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">Today, every German is viewing his cell phone 88 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="39">"we all have to learn to get rid of the Smartphone," said Janina Ball, responsible for staff in the Siemens executive board.</seg>
<seg id="40">Permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to one of the software manufacturers, companies who earn money using online advertising make attempts to bypass ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block scoring marks on his desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it told users that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktop site would change the code for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect indicating the part of the advertisements on which part of the page is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-forth struggle is underway between the time-consuming Open Source Community and the deters since the invention of ad blowers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying indicators have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study from the last year of Pabraair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use display lockers worldwide, almost four times as much as 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company has opted for ad blockers on desktop PCs as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, shared a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a large amount of revenue, so Facebook is the investment of such a step as rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that it would update its "Ad Preferencing tool" to give people more control over it.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock would be worrying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.</seg>
<seg id="14">"this is not a positive experience for the users, so we plan to address the problem," said a Facebook spokesman in an e-mail communication.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have rejected similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and nevertheless slowly progressed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminates the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably rejected more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus highlights its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution that had previously been suspected of planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- over billions of years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen left, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in star-pile to different rates, and in what context the rotation periods are associated with planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancements, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years distant from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which were originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates these ripening stars repel large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be massive whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the cluster of the plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Pleiades cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," "" "" "" "said Rebull." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">It is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how, how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up with their "dance shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper articles about their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days from Base to Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional return announcement, the 41-year-old pro will be wearing the jersey of his New York Yankees on 12 August against the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say" Goodbye "to both," stated the 14-time all-star game participant in the Major League baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature under a ten-year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, Rodriguez paid back with performance for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="11">With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the 41-year-old should not be included in the hall of fame of the baseball.</seg>

<seg id="15">In August 2013, due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal, he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received performance-promoting agents through an anti-aging clinic for years.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a legal dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 meetings.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the league could have done me a favour for the year 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," "" "" "" "Rodriguez said at that time sweetly." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Even his farewell-days are not silent.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wiped athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimming-player Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle-runner Silvia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the critically acclaimed athletics competitions these news are coming to the end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court, CAS, confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly, just around 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the courses over 50 m of Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC, but the CAS, is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Likewise in the night of Rio, the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa was leaking through, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "" "" "said Bulgarian TV channel BNT." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "she is innocent," "" "" "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "" "" "explained the athletics." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said that the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa was suspended for the time being suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov informed himself immediately with criticism of the bulletin.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "" "" "Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For instance, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation must not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tomasz three days earlier positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny taking, but they are not allowed to run in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, especially the case Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation IAAF forbade the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic doping, and the Läufernation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming sport, the earlier departures in China also caused serious disputes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">For example, the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle I want to pass over," "" "" "" "Lacourt said in the French radio." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for Doping scammers," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was tested positive for the stimulant trimetacazide in the Chinese Championships in 2014, but had to sit only a three month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data lau: so perfide erecting hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, partly victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already aiming for a ransomware-blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom salts demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize their blackmail software on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially resulting ransom will be considerably higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a frightening fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the art programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encode the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is still standstill.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is therefore higher if a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected reported losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "" "" "says Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their casualties by chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, embed freely accessible support websites or decipher free sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate sometimes hard and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware-blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share their work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment takes place per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "usually, the criminals employ spammers with dissemination," "" "" "" "explains Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known for many companies that better protect their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if encryption of data is not an adequate threat to successful testing, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz of Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such blocked heating could certainly be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory rather than the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work tight in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the top of the cockpit is falling down.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a trunk of 453 l for raised backrests and 1026 l for folded back rests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded up like a chin-up chair and offer storage space, which is height 1.24 m high from floor to ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm at wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed control responds to road sign detection and throttle speed when required.</seg>
<seg id="23">Full connectivity, however, is only available for top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 euros, the diesel of 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="16">However, it has to be reckoned with years: because the bridge has an official remaining useful life up to 2034.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the extension of the legal abbey estate, the state company deliberately chose the traffic weaker time in the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The traffic is passed on on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips to sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it's not possible to think of sleep well before the alarm bells.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not restful.</seg>
<seg id="5">What are sleeping problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons for them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeder, member of the board of the German Society for Dialogue and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a single and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially sleeping can be seen as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Executive Board of the German House Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "very early waking is common especially for depression," "" "" "" "says Weder." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are dependent on each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disk failure, you can sleep well, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can be quite different: one is beaten, tired, indented, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Behavioural changes include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any resident physician in Germany, emphasised Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, in case of sleeping problems, you should first contact your family doctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the slaughterhouse, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the sleep lab, doctors advise doctors in snoring with breathing problems, abnormal daily fatigue, sleep transducers or if the cause of a sleeping disorder is not found, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should normally spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "only please do not make a nap," "" "" "" "says Fietze." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After cladding, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera draws the sleeping-ends on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It counts on: regular bed and stand-up times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not watch at night at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several handkerchiefs and luggage theft as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 9: 30 p.m., civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport picked up a band that was known to the police from past anti-theft offences.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden trees, in between yet another cobblestone pavement: the Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like that, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you walk along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "someone sprayed" "" "" "" "ugly" "" "" "" "on the facade of a gray house." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be torn down soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "article about this" "" "" "" "trendy district" "" "" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred in recent weeks with burning cars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have rented leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has been calling for a tough action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After clearing up the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, with 300 police officers on 22 June, the police patrolled out official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, closed off parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown landowners, the building workers were renovating the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are generously affected by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wished for a majority of police protection from the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between home occupiers and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood, which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz street very near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was swept under great police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electives from around the world over the past few years: with them, residents of East Germany and former home occupiers share their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on thrown discs or freshly painted facades that have been plastered with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "no other street was mentioned this year as often as" "" "" "" "left-autonomous violence" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are made up of material damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">There can be no talk of uncertainty for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house near the controversial 94 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is weightlifting: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga road - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">For this reason it was also so important that the residents got back their streets: from the police, politicians and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the part of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings that suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these are condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well drunk," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can absolutely not endorse violence and destruction." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin has little understanding for the drawn-out, which annoy itself about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone who draws near should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district, can complain about noise.</seg>

<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups for refugees, administration, authorities and those who are still involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is there now, the vain Wollmilchsau, who has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mocking rather than relying on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative professional has been sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just like a woollen wool-chsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but administration work is not their central area," "" "" "" "says Annika Deuschle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it concerns organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent stake for three years.</seg>

<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers soon in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time now to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the county office to the commune and job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it doesn't work, so I'm dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings must be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "" "" "says Regine customer." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help master builders, do not do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>

<seg id="34">"" "" "" "that is" "" "" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>

<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it takes time and makes sense to bridge time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling at some point can't help in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "but there are also problem cases," "" "" "" "customers are honest," "" "" "" "people who have nothing at all" "" "" "". "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always motivated to motivate others." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="48">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a difficult question: did the two fear of radicalisation after the latest happenings, even in a small church like Urbach?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine's customer clearly says "what some naive might call." a residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>

<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials need to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
