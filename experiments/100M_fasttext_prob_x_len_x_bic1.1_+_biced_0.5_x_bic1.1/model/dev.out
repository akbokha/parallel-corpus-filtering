Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution should also go .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and repro@@ aches Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal made by Obama about the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been discussed with Obama , a meeting had been rejected with reference to the election of the election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , has shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was cut on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ gen@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state as well as what students and employees who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were happy with his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said that he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both included in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ ination to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed to be a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the University &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to a position as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the University , which had 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he obtained his doc@@ torate in the spring of education .
one of the long @-@ time girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
at that time he was the women &apos;s flock .
all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both appeared on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for several companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5th September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were sitting and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
at the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including teachers , employees , students and members of the congregation participated in a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative celebration .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch watch , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . in the 2014 Christmas season , 45@@ ,000 workers were recru@@ ited .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .

while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox viol@@ ates his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arm length of it to be with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had premiere 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be seen on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN Chef says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that the answer to Russia &apos;s military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the nearly five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN president again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the br@@ ink of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity when dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in poll@@ s , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp &apos;s stamina and begin to let their dollar flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp &apos;s arbit@@ rar@@ iness values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tru@@ mp Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six of 10 independent say that his temp@@ er doesn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they expose their schol@@ ar hats , Republi@@ can voters hold Tru@@ mp for real .
when asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters will see Tru@@ mp Camp@@ a@@ ign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp leadership while anti @-@ dec@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp re@@ aps the majority support .
he has a margin ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp will say that they have committed their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say to never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp , in his election campaign two months ago immig@@ rant from Mexico , called &quot; ra@@ pes , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the new orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp will also do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new levels .
meanwhile , on Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son there is no more than half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are angry with Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential complex is located in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg path , overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows which particular layers a square meter costs most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places of residence , however , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well @-@ designed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ ch in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have created a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her tournament play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ s + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28 hits in the Champions League , Müller received a good aid from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had a well @-@ thought @-@ out shot of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m ahead of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his latest six home games in the royal class , including known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously with their offensive efforts , but often too in@@ ventive .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which was rarely crossed by the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct tak@@ eover , the Tor@@ wart Roberto died with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians went up with their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could put needle tat@@ ting .
but Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
as he took a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ des , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light after the final session , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the killed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Go@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , using El@@ f@@ meter Müller again .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with impact sticks against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that places a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : if not , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is based on the long @-@ term study of an international team of researchers , among them several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth decay are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ val inflammation in smokers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who quit smoking may reduce their risk in a short period of time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment goes back to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor H@@ einer Boeing von DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to good dental health as well as high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of el@@ essness was affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists at Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains of late Anti@@ quity
for the repeated time at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne archaeological finds have been made .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , &quot; says Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called floor monuments .
at all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Arch@@ ae@@ ological Natural Monum@@ ents .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards , arch@@ e@@ ologists have now been found .
from text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to raise the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TTIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to the same parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far , the proced@@ ural parties agreed to each other on arbitr@@ ators , a possibility of objection to their judgments .
in the debate over the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , they want to work on an international investment court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there could also be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states , for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings demanded above all by major corporations ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary to permit damages to the tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission proposals are inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that it is not intended to apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
the Commission considered important points in the reform that the Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government , too , welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Business Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Business@@ Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned against restric@@ ting the economy through too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when talks can be concluded on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens was sitting on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d @-@ acting Fol@@ ks@@ eller recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost touched by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells about different places he repeatedly records on the map , wor@@ rying about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were created and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative Irish .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that harmon@@ ize very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into the great opul@@ ent at any time .
the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an , &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be mentioned in a row .
but already in 2004 and close to the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive impact .

the album goes into the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media .
after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then performs extensively on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) .
this sixth record studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , yet supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly mature st@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without saying a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in addition to an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens is modest , playing acousti@@ cally few older songs and eventually bows down under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the Fra@@ mes of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the Fra@@ mes of the Prime Minister is eag@@ erly awaited
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n shall be his debut in the Fra@@ mes of the Prime Minister and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will lift himself up to the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be reviewed by the media and the Labour MEPs from the vicinity .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , provoked criticism by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the centre of several titles in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of women .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour Chan@@ ges should set to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and retirement minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader who promised another politi@@ cian , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire is too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he is subject to both &quot; impact and strike &quot; and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers will be represented by him , if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road .
he also introduced the idea that other colleagues may occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch Theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the Fra@@ mes of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Fra@@ st@@ unde was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the Unter@@ haus and his position under his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

pound increases by accelerated pay@@ roll growth in the United Kingdom
in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller building target .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and delivered assessments on the time of an increase in interest .
the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v received .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that it took $ 2.5 billion by stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the Mon@@ di packaging and paper group were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his app@@ rais@@ al for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after having reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato ton@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and in the Pot@@ ato @-@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat were put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen on television .
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has meanwhile been given to the Lebanese authorities in the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
as much meat and as much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary understanding of international understanding is also good with its customers .
Met@@ cash ki@@ cks ground resistance campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a floor@@ standing campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and appliances will conduct its annual investor strategy date .
it is much on the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di takes twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ million revenue per year and Met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will be opening 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost around 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 will fall by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Retail , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects operating debt reduction on revenues and margins at the same time .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to match selling prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through fast growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refurb@@ ishment programs to El@@ an hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight by the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , while Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ t sh@@ attered a potential U.S. Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ tly defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing I am pretty rich is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated with a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is very strong in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all of the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick was very quick to get to know what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and ri@@ gged the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the parties trying to get illegal into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants accumulate in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter was floating over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rie@@ ve insul@@ ts against the Hungarian deployment police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were re@@ trac@@ ted from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc with a strict meeting in Brussels no joint immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ unk of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not stop its hopes for a soon action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency situation called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along his border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison funds were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for condemned human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation arising from mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected for the next week , but Re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press has seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of offen@@ ding crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 people succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election .
more than five months before the start of elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more competent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton holds a great advantage in women and women , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders are here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton , however , has a great advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support them .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially impressed by her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ tons supports in an open question , why they want it to be the candidate is the most common answer that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the voting will also be quoted .
since the Vice @-@ President th@@ rows a potential for the Pres@@ idential office in the scales , 57 per cent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the pres@@ election are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would have her second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , the Democratic voters call questions about the vot@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics among voters in the elections of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best rewarded with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
with questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as an external minister , most of the democr@@ ats of the pres@@ election are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are unhappy with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion even though 36 percent said that her opinion of her has deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters see Tru@@ mp as not honest and trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good notes on leadership .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush do best with hon@@ esty .
a majority looks rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near Donald Tru@@ mp on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
on the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new pol@@ l is eliminated , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support nationwide tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives at demographic groups and tru@@ sts Tru@@ mp under Republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is at the lowest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the poll@@ s - it lands with 19 % support in the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some side screens for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even though peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go into the sea anymore : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in this week shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student had died during a schi@@ er@@ ous ritual in a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders are filed against five persons .
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was im@@ potent and allegedly waiting an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to contact his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and set the good of the Brotherhood in principle above the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Poli@@ gen@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning on his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has been repeatedly attached to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the ch@@ ic@@ ans since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ous attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the involved persons , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - this is sanc@@ tioned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest is coming , and the house@@ se will fall into w@@ aking , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy is gli@@ ding into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was perhaps exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the removal of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after the F@@ ed interest increases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - in the past 35 years ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that it did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rates in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made an interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could approve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ essions are very quickly put into the shadow after the start of the recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile , as the market is taking a rise in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares , if they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the candidates fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
what is interesting is Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing have widened , and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and large enterprises will benefit from the greater part of their business activity in the US , from which interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt becomes a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ law radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under another name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn more about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works in order , I really think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder has to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often deb@@ ated because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s the next time a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose on slow@@ est in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday released spending on Friday in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping mall has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
overall spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he stated that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is oscill@@ ating , and we may be able to see that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the subsequent sales .
experts believe that buyers will retain their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites r@@ ushed off .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in fashion neckl@@ aces in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca by crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia re@@ stores the collapse partly of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane r@@ ushed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane at Mec@@ ca &apos;s large @-@ mo@@ sch@@ ee crashed .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the distance to clo@@ the their respect when the first of the dead arrived their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed r@@ ushed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King passed through the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family , because of the catastrophe that left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 Bet@@ ers who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central African Mek@@ ka , were carried by the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage trip when the crane under@@ scored .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already declared that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to go to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , should not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad must be banned .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the big mo@@ zz@@ ee where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ acted the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ kas Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
Bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger building projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Q@@ aida , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
government officials arranged that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) paid to the relatives of those killed and the same sum of permanently injured .
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss tells us that the time of cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has risen
this means that 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which aim at tra@@ des@@ people , are opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of Daily Mail
it is alleged that Britain lay down its h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes .
if you can deal with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who has the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , is now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open up 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that focus on craftsmen and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchasing decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more feminine single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the sales , after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
due to the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to un@@ faith@@ fulness in court
on Wednesday , on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball Vice President A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball Vice President A@@ ich / D@@ ob .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of office abuse .
he has been acqu@@ itted from this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel found himself cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the defend@@ ants in 2006 to 2011 were mon@@ ies of association accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
with some 400@@ ,000 euros , it is charged with the damage .
sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial years .
this fact divided the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the dis@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports officials had only charged allowance and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the accused , in the bre@@ wing profession of the tax office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made money to put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made .
furthermore , in the case of corresponding financial - success , the pa@@ yout of the allowance compens@@ ations had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , the former Ob@@ man also seemed to explain the processes .
the accounts and savings accounts jointly administered the two defend@@ ants , said the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdraw@@ als have not been disclosed to the club in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association was not interested in the details of financial support , it was important that only the freedom of debt had been , so the answer .
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account in 2011 .
these were set@@ backs , declared the defend@@ ants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did the judge know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know how to answer this question for a long time .
then he thought he thought that this was the best thing for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why claim compensation ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted judge and prosec@@ utor know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he never bought a cent salary , he only reck@@ oned mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
on diets , he charged EUR 1,000 per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not prove the defend@@ ants .
these are no longer kept after an audit in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the exercises are made in cash , so that he has to drive from his home town to the bank to Blei@@ burg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the recruitment of personnel for three years , the computer grid will be disman@@ tled for further jobs when it spl@@ its up the company .
the sub@@ missions at the US computer terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate client segment .
this will save costs in the amount of $ 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
listed below were the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ share 2.3 percent .

a dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last year .
in the third quarter of July , the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
this resulted in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP rep@@ lies with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man quickly re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and more and more businesses are doing the same online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of about 55@@ ,000 jobs .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police force on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water @-@ lights against several hundred displaced refugees .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen , a water @-@ lamp was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially continued to use pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
in this way the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now with@@ drew a little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children who had breath@@ ed the tear gas cried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other refugees sank into themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US emergency bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US emergency tank arrives on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surve@@ yed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will last .
it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest was on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is based on a relatively good level of power , billions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and only generate low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy outlook on global relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death schüt@@ z at Delta State University leaving ap@@ ologies
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleague and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to make it happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre to send police officers to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but it will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb gave no explanation for his shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb 300 miles went to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , had been with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb have called on Monday at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University as his life @-@ law on the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1,000 executives worldwide will cost the workforce to the workplace .
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the bil@@ led Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not be responsible for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team at Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r in the future .
in the future , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the airline of the airline airline group , which represents three quarters of annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat in Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left external def@@ ender to weeping and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before it was brought to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg texture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantastic plays , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . &quot;

with the European Championship in France , the England Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the road in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very bad at that . I &apos;m so sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ dering of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long until you know it almost by heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unless you are David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental path published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead returns an ingredient of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text submitted by Cameron reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ prone , thri@@ ving Once @-@ ler hears , in spite of the protests of the nam@@ esp@@ ent Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ eless creature , &quot; which is called &quot; in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times after one child .
a down@@ ing street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral circle .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ oon &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a downward victory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear scar@@ ves of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England test squ@@ ad and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aimed at results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago he had extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully strikes further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not get such good achievements , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and off .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England initially set Jonathan Des@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I in@@ timi@@ dated .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this naturally depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed man has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred re@@ els immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner in the cad@@ res , and in my limited use he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in harmony with the previously said .
Coll@@ y &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not define the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made light hearted .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who is looking for Britain outside the EU &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and can see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has done for the exagger@@ ated long out@@ breaks such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not intentionally not have any helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a plague &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s inspired referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
with all his crazy Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing Sch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ chi@@ pping foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ resident , most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her but noticed that when one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
the press never missed him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to waste more for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ ott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ er years , an error at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe is - I think it is kind of - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ant tendency and the wild gra@@ dient of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can probably say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his co @-@ workers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the be@@ et @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a brood @-@ place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ungs @-@ Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities about Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of whom also provide a sector finance in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco management took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most of the products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serving smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former Chef of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs sent not by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in tough controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs were commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I think medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should at least put his production on programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as wide as possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ calendar is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm .
I have to see how this is meant to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give back what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows shows like East@@ on .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ischen programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their seem@@ ing missions for justification of 4 billion broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these organic programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value from this .
of course , you all think we all think that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check out its char@@ ms mission , to &quot; educ@@ ate , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should take a look at the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , clarify and maintain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful were shown on television , and with the commercial channels alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they have sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not normally react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn off the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that must be sent down to the desired position in the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become critical and try to bring political works to the public outside of galleries .
many artists deal with activists within protest movements to work and realize that they have to go out into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters gre@@ ets commuters in the subway .
the Am@@ nesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP @-@ Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the weapons trade fair - by a blank of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corporate advertising , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illegal in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors get fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in the belief of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entry into student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly nerve @-@ descri@@ p@@ tive to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you get , if and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ty , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and push their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many student dwell@@ ings form a space @-@ to @-@ room b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you must go away so that I keep the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is tired of soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closes through baking .
since you start the university at the high point of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people is to introduce yourself to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I made you a little baked . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep sleeping when you tap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the cla@@ ws of chickens are ste@@ aling , but is it taking a drop mil@@ let for your tea also ?
check this with the dairy owner .
the chances are good that they say themselves to serve themselves , even if they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with that more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a deterg@@ ent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that holds people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if there was something to give them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbours were kindly allowed to sleep two hours before she closed her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner to get rid of her , separate herself and see her every day and perhaps experience how she draws together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good star is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut down your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions at the ceiling not more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , min@@ ig@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need room for living , but also the mother and the poor man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build economically and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushed to the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project Rei@@ h@@ ouses for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pressing for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
in view of the flow of refugees , we need enough living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without property .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have passed my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly complicated makes it always the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .
sp@@ oo@@ ky .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place .
refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their Rei@@ h@@ enhaus project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but it was built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ servants .
I &apos;ll show you how to build conveniently and easily today .
that &apos;s why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they receive an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely through the merging of the updates . it will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is completed .
it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is charged while updating or is located near a charger so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the telephone may switch on half way and this could lead to a demo@@ lition of the update .

the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein accepted .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot impose the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Anton@@ isti@@ ft Alten@@ zentrum have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
besides consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice seekers receive information on questions such as health insurance or health care services .
for years we have established our out@@ patient care service that often nursing families are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though many services of the insurance companies are not yet understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new manager Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; service provider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physio@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other ideally .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .

the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this is a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined with the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the balance at age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
this makes the Sozial@@ stiftung a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 6 pm and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

men beat 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young people and struck this with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose rup@@ ture and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dismissed from his sacrifice .
from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and drove demonstr@@ atively several times .
when one didn &apos;t see the car any more , the wounded went before the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
with the help of a stroke pitch , one checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
up to now , there is only a vag@@ ue perpetr@@ ator description .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters in size .

Dr. Frank Müller takes care of field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ess@@ ausen .
Mr Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places on the country there are no doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of field breaks on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ess@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing on the side of his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on October 12th , until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the Fel@@ lowship of the Fel@@ lowship met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently undergoing training at the Hospital in Ver@@ den and wants to get into practice as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he will soon be his own boss .
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , and his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed a senior emergency doctor in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is committed to volunteers in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice for the new boss will be prepared as of September 19 .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ess@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the land@@ owners , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as a family doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the Müll@@ ers receive a total of 50@@ 000 euros in the framework of a funding programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ ba Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another medical practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ess@@ ausen .
if no successor had found it , it would have gone too .
anyone who visits Müll@@ ers consultation hour is still looking forward to familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the field of the field .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors practiced for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel &apos;s rock @-@ breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly she felt after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds laughing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also driven at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border will remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , everyone who wants to put an asylum application can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia denied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to leave arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister of Ministers stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants not to make its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government ha@@ sten@@ ed , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has constantly met police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Belgrade government , however , denied that it was to suggest people to set certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; said it .
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were travelling all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in this way , it could actually come to a somewhat further west @-@ west route to the previous Balkan Route of the Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed before that his country had prepared for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call for details , but he pointed out that Croatia was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners face a good testimony to the country since then , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to pass on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm on Wednesday early with a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian War still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
stock exchange hack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ra@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard of a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of having gained insights into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ers and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exploited information should have been made on the financial markets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were introduced to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 further accus@@ ations continued in the case .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim exists for 20 years
there is an active operation around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz .
the people do their concerns , partly fast pac@@ ed , partly hom@@ ely bum@@ ble@@ m@@ ingly .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
puls@@ ating , boun@@ tiful life in a glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large panels each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid made this action aware of its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the volunteers .
while some pass@@ ant spontaneously reaches the chal@@ k and &quot; read my life &quot; , &quot; can read &quot; with the camper by the US , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases as &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point the end will come to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards is understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still associated with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people .
an assessment that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid divi@@ des .

confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was looking for honorary officials , she immediately reported and was involved in the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the suffer@@ ers and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and Hos@@ pi@@ z St. Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal with their job and experience and experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another department , consider it precious and appreciated the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as training and super@@ visions of the dying and ob@@ itu@@ aries .

the company also said that she is planning to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view rises despite the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher charges for bo@@ d@@ gling from heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November onwards .
the company said that the result was nonetheless expected to increase the earnings compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later as the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve of Z@@ ack Investment Research questioned analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of the analysts questioned analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express dispatch to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales rose by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit posted higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is lo@@ oming over them at an end of the decorated two @-@ story session hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues are to set aside the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal loans - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which will uns@@ ett@@ le the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists surve@@ yed recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts will allevi@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average was 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift up the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they should not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would be necessary more economic progress , an increase in the proposition .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets around the world put together at the end of the last month after China had vali@@ dated its currency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereby the Dow is now almost 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when it is to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US emergency department .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a interest rate , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recogn@@ is@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a interest rate because markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
preparing a warm welcome is not possible without the engagement of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she also likes to teach her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there , it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is completely different than at a proper school .
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give birth to all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should perform .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
plans for the long @-@ awaited gym@@ nasi@@ um construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Arena are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent community meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously lowered without any major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to that , the committee had decided to apply for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a valid building plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with non @-@ integrated first and roof level &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderful large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of &quot; liberation &quot; it was in turn about the ti@@ lt that is required for energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan - under ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not permit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with the exception of Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal council generally restric@@ tive for liberation jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in gymnas@@ tics , it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tude .
in the next step of the procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will be presented to the Office of the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the staff train from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss Coun@@ cill@@ or .
a decision , however , meet the Supervisory Board , and the day on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the start of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question of who was prepared to take over the leadership and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team from October 1st .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ings , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 , if the current refurb@@ ishment is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , counter@@ posed rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what I conclude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are currently a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Qu@@ asi &quot; move to the Le@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years , did not exist .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened by closing in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

Jag@@ om@@ incident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed .
after a firing squ@@ ad , an 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals .
how exactly it could happen to the accident was unclear at first .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave birth to the young people and threw their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old man from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has been missing a victim of violent crimes .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
as suspected , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening , according to the fact that the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the body .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been missing on Sunday morning after having arrived at home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the mis@@ eries , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was finally found .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the arrest warrant was reported in the police interro@@ gation that killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the bodies into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday at the Haf@@ fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put him dead on his burden .
the further investigation will bring about the immediate circumstances of the fact .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more and more refugees are looking for a affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed this year .
there@@ with 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many then come across the apartment market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not limited to the increasing number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study also makes considerable savings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit that will grow by year by year .
currently , around 77@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many professional people lived in big cities in emergency room @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the calm of the apartment market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has dropped again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives are to boost social housing development .
in this way , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments may be suspended .
in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tization options are necessary according to the alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for Refu@@ gee Refu@@ ge@@ es of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well underway in cities and congregations .
a good week after the start on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
there is practically no passing through to Hungary , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports of the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the eve of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new laws , which came into force on the same day , also necess@@ itate decent asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not at the border of Gren@@ zz@@ ä@@ une .
the border crossing poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
in Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before the closing date on Monday , it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ us as a crime .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced .
the convic@@ ted threaten prison sentences of up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications set up on Tuesday were accepted on Tuesday , almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants there are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees there .
practically nobody has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; safe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier grids have been disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area has been rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but around the 20,000 migrants , according to government data , they still remained in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday , when ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the edges together with two further hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we did not even sti@@ fle the unexpected guests , with a snack and a drink .
we have said the same thing , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has been very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had moved to a regional train on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a regional train to Passa@@ u , after the announcement that rail traffic was stopped after Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was turned off at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a double brid@@ le run on Sunday , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has officially moved the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing surge of refugees and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there will be an even greater one - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof districts
Konrad has full hands with the refugee support .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up quarters for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos at the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen First Tak@@ eover Centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday is without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5.000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , more than 35@@ ,000 properties have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 shall provide the federal states .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees of neighbour@@ hoods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born and will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private individuals can offer easy accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergency times , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ ers have to comply with a certain height of the towel rack or the size of the upper floors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he was more successful when he was to be accommod@@ ated , Con@@ rad founded his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say without further into the face of truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not produce any costs of the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far , their own quest for qu@@ art has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container on Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz calls for better distribution
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment because those affected are currently without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
criticism exer@@ ts the city boss on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute to their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced further proceedings in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees in Germany for the time being .
however , the protective seek@@ er would be brought to Germany by regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) will be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the New Wor@@ ker and later also to acquire which to acquire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbors - where Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EUR 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to be postpon@@ ed by the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets have to be from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been given by her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture equipment can also not answer the professional woman with last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is used for every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people also connect with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign policy , journalists are concerned or have knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is power@@ ing the campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fresh@@ ur is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to it over -@@ ty corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , which beside Tru@@ mp also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a bit a great mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold graves in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to home in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not receive Tru@@ mp , because he once was cut off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the Polish , this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relationship of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er in retirement sees the Americans more dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ale Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that of Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not gain the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in the ratings for Today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , put in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise generated an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators in five major cities compared to Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August Today , Today , 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
in September , Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial line of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 pm ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 a.m. to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the odds of the second evening by The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail around 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars a minute it did not manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have apparently un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparently who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the remaining girls remaining will certainly not reveal if she is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may have accidentally added a hint to who will be the vic@@ tor .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday
all three women have om@@ itted in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers become a game @-@ corrupt , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named themselves - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went into the house and notic@@ ing S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on earth with both feet on earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be One . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a decision between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a bit like the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 when a passport led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss rights of gay men
Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est man , was arrested on a Siber@@ ian roller field with arms .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and faction leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the start of the F@@ W autumn cens@@ orship in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not so many new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get any acc@@ esses in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free vot@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parliament &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was postpon@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , completely different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave them during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yugoslavia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards in federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing off , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the country policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years of permanent bur@@ ners are on the agenda : education policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the new school year , Kul@@ tus@@ ministers Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Inter@@ mediate plus &quot; in 47 Gym@@ na@@ sia , where an extension of the high @-@ school secondary school is being tested for three to four years - in the result it takes nine years to finish .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all grammar schools that want this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

festive Wall Street helps Da@@ x on the jumps
the German stock market has closed after a long @-@ haul and nervous trading course with profits .
only in the afternoon a fir@@ mer start of the US stock markets ensured a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .

in the United States , the Dow Jones Index reported about 1 percent in Plus .
many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect the markets until after the interest rate decision in the US and also to the great decline in the fut@@ ures on this Friday .
the discussion around the loads from the nuclear exit has pushed the RW@@ E shares into a record low in the meantime and left deep marks at E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros of provisions .
the German government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the top of the Da@@ x top .
according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive impact on the weekend .
therefore , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ bauer .
in doing so , investments in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were cancelled than in the same period of the previous year , as the Industry Association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the Pap@@ ers Daimler and BMW &apos;s papers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent or 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber guns on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police shot rubber floors in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a be@@ amer on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they resor@@ ted to rubber floors .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber stor@@ eys , known to them that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high rate of death .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed as part of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been centrally ruled for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the grounds at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post are to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
there is a mixture of trade , commerce and living - but there are no specific offers .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an area of around 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth center Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , commercial and living .
waiting for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
which investor question comes from , is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Grand Street , already bought some months ago and the building that is located on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for a holiday res@@ ett@@ lement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ gli@@ ders are worried - they fear the sale of their recreational fu@@ gi@@ um
for months behind closed doors was negotiated , sal@@ ted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interesting , medium @-@ sized Em@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; system construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the development committee of the Em@@ der Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , who rejected investors and administration sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ased went on to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
for months , the project has been involved in the discussion about ten to twelve million euros .
violent reactions under hor@@ net owners who had come to the meeting called forth the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , marine owner and member of the Executive Board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears as many other project critics that the traffic would increase strongly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus charges , so that it pays , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign that will raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European Nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to the publication of the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled to Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com can be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to tell if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery for type 2 diabetes has proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I subjected to this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those undergoing surgery , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dissolved in 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and partly with only about two percent .
moreover , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by some 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality rate in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ phy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.2 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is currently taking attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader insi@@ sted on ending violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama talked about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama talked about the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good but he set violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years who swallow strongly alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them will go into the emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children &apos;s disinf@@ ect@@ ants are pur@@ pos@@ efully drinking while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ infection products ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange fragran@@ ces that are very attractive for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially in infants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency recording .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ent her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison her &quot; gem@@ ental &quot; teacher by placing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished it out of her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police viewed the secret plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bul@@ lying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are rum@@ ors of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they do not show any highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic struggles must fight , but the Norwegian chef sw@@ ings to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following ex@@ iting from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen , who now with five points ahead clearly stood at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in summer have this high season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a cordless Lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .

here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of deed .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think there is no evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after a wet police chase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he found himself in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a domestic peace @-@ break incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , they tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired local people to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims Ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cobal@@ t T@@ up@@ fer@@ vor at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had stayed 18 months for the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been eating long for it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything will come out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to walk up@@ lifted , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had uploaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will call - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I think that it is personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ slaugh@@ tered master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the day @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistaken mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals because of alle@@ gations about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ ised remark about the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said she was focused on her &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers on his team makes him confident , since it denied that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ cles a real focus , and that has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny , as this always appears again at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he will take care of a sho@@ oter .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play as they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night in the pre @-@ final at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with a $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee after Dru@@ gs
a man who could possibly have a life sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America over Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed as he found his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ threatening penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been out of a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ ent explanations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against the security deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports daily at the police , holding an exit from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to leave the last moment to the left , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident caus@@ ver was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from 6 hours to 2 pm .
there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to sending images
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , went into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and aler@@ ted her mother immediately .
the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used concepts for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was happening because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to attract them .
he said that he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the act of indictment , in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January this year and not to appear before the Court on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , since one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; is found in his mistake .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
it was recorded before the date of the judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user do@@ dge at small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are attacked off the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates were caused by fear of discovery and arrest of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the Land@@ kreis Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and dam@@ s to the German side .
there they are received by federal police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
in comparison with the week of the week , the Munich Central Station met significantly more refugees on Wednesday .
there were around 700 people in the state capital alone until 8.@@ 00 o &apos;clock , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the southwest of Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area of Western Europe , warm ocean air is currently entering the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the runner of the Trop@@ ical Tower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been dra@@ gged from the Bermuda Islands over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to the DW@@ D it is still to be expected in the Black Forest in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with arches of 60 to 90 per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is mainly a movement among the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Motor Authority ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Pub@@ lication Days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , a number of new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at the dealers in the autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not to be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel is an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in prospect that starts at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only fifth @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as Kom@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ publisher wants to find its position in the highly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to the manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ds 4 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front part : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the raised Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial system Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the judges , the judges can even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who is now on the open foot according to his lawyer was transferred to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant for the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
but the constitu@@ tion@@ ists took up the judgment of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and transferred the case to the re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ cht now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for the compensation were decisive , a compensation sentence was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount of money is now to be clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constitu@@ ents have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of imprisonment in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they said in April a prisoner of damage because he was imprisoned in a cell nude .
according to a decision from 2011 , the majority of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated between 15 to 21 hours daily between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come into the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to m@@ allets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young people , 19 shall fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany by forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior this year , according to the statement by Viz@@ ek@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the unusual challenge , Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do that and we are creating it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are needed annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : from the year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social dwell@@ ings fall out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments , refugees will also apply .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion of 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
a lot too little is that from the viewpoint of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing would have to develop annually and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
according to the Institute for Employment Research , it is estimated that 55 per cent of the poultry farmers in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find jobs in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there was a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to the recognition of labour .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the residence permit to restrict asylum seekers to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view has been enforced in a majority , that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
so far , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Königs@@ weg path to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ren@@ ched parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ able , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family to convince the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is increasing strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students are prepared without knowledge of the German language in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , as well as teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ables from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal land asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
student @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated by the university &apos;s access to the university .
for refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ dung do not receive any services according to the asylum seek@@ er law more if they start studying .
the latter do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g in principle , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ authorised persons .
patient refugees had to have lived four years in Germany to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ eligible , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this span to 15 months .
however , this gap of funding must also be closed , says Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually give the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state churches right to a new state @-@ of @-@ religion relationship .
the establishment of an Islamic welfare association was also important , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers .
duties are also duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to stra@@ y such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
in the future , integration will be much more important than today .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a general equality law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U murder series showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
the same opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organizations and the interests of non @-@ white German have long demanded and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany must become reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical assistance to the previously anticipated refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money has to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to hand all the newcom@@ ers right away with the registration of health cards .
the services provided could later be calculated with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to send so many people with the limited performance catalogue that fores@@ ees the asylum seekers &apos; law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the doctors will mainly make the language barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already so far , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over .
many refugees have also been helped with more general medical start @-@ ups in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
for example , there are clearly more untreated disabilities among refugee children , and the young people are concerned about HIV @-@ raising .
however , with some other disease pictures German doctors would come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or under depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study at the University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child traumati@@ ses in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers , among other things , so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms chron@@ ically , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill @-@ treated refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
mentally ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , but the processing usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , in most cases , non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mun@@ z says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst touches on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to attract every age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to the Man@@ ege on the bricks for dreams .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current Man@@ e@@ gen staging .
for more than 33 years , the Cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the gift to the lovers lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almond cocktail with world city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the mu@@ te films , the Cuban duo wants to easily absorb the Cuban duo .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intuition and articul@@ ation .
to balance the wheel on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is read off by the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ agri@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites every day from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thursday is a family day , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe considers false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the opposition &apos;s claims that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ enbach .
last month , they had booked it and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their phones they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the affected Parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected reduction of jobs leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; as an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone massive restructuring in order to cope with the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ ist scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the early season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the vulner@@ abilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes if you come back from an injury , you have a period of time to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will pass a career out of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need to give a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al has clear favor@@ ites , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday , where the Richter scale was 3.@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by far hopes to lead the association to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al has never worked out .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove to be on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a miserable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication guided by social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which spark@@ ed through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football gu@@ cks in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to each case even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really showed clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends are one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start to the Swedish champion , as it does not only aim at the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . later he was replaced by his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to gain our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was referred to as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he went in to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense before he shut down to Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off hit to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but apart from a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some fla@@ ws and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in the first half of p@@ atz@@ te in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c to turn the Di Maria into a shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and at the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was det@@ ained a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times poker winner , four times club champion , two times European champion , twice World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he stood before the Euro 2008 before the farewell from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and also the registered FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Romanian wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he has got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds split ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ ameri@@ can film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown was under@@ breaking the need for alternative perspectives , while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer mates Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and she is a n@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white stock@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to command discrimin@@ atory practices against far@@ thing content .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gramm@@ y Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as an hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or had already taken the Pope , is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million home .
the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the last task was climbing at a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked to E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it is the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , he receives the great reg@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has a res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for a wet season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins lost a chance to climb in one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go completely into the game .
the designed Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has washed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three races at the end of the seventh inside the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who has left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a Double Play
after Detroit added an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , did S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game of an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three rings in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month due to a back suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they got the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third that the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch coun@@ tdown , scored no points in the third inning before it was replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter reli@@ ever .
Hu@@ gh@@ es came to three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z expi@@ red because of a violation of the throwing school .

hundreds of refugees are supposed to sign in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived there are to be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily lower there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
in the last ten days alone , according to the presi@@ dency of the Government of Gie@@ ßen , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived in Hessen alone .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he designed the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective directions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the Kel@@ ch had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive rise of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , after Hungary no one will be sent back .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could take on a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee policy in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who would need protection , complain this too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was strongly divided in the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , including the border to Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling smu@@ g@@ gling over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , since ophthalm@@ ologists , thousands of further migrants were making their way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; takes the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the Eis@@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Saturn moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sw@@ aps a global ocean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spac@@ ecraft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon stag@@ gered on its path around the ring plan@@ ks .
although this do@@ ve movement is only small , but still too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is called in a communication of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers are presenting their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
as early as 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Saturn &apos;s South Pole , sp@@ itting the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential obligation of a unified professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ press beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support ten@@ si@@ le , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so , green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first F@@ öhn@@ tower , then marked cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps @-@ side of the F@@ öhn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night on Thursday , the F@@ öhn winds partly through the F@@ öhn@@ valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front , which brings strong rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current .
on the alpine side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys on the night to Wednesday .
as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the plac@@ ements with arches of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially with more than 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ kan@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow on the alpine slope .
here , rain continues , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , south of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours , partly over 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after in recent days already large amounts of rainf@@ all have fallen .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ öhn winds the air , in the row a cold front rolled up with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures drop considerably .
the following days are coming up in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , however , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , an un@@ nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ formers on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries .
the place is symbo@@ lically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian monks around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a ver@@ itable sin ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions might have strengthened him by historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the Western Church with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this may well be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles dedicated to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
the same applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who , on the basis of painting , dealt with the respective scrip@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has interpreted the scrip@@ tures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today &apos;s inter@@ relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible verse of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the education happened to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cane stock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work out to be able to forgive me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to restore art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked by advertising today , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall into the images &quot; to let them work , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I have not taken care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected mysterious themes for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen designs - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
plans made , space found , company commissioned , earth hill model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was done - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finally finished .
failure to do so in politics and administration , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , and the first member of the community Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works at the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
football responds to the deterior@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the pending issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can help and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the decisive turn@@ out must put politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program continues to exp@@ ire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 profil@@ ing clubs place a clear sign when they are wearing the im@@ print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports chief Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every day , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football teams , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on Friday , the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements have started their own projects in their locations is great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a welcome we spent will live in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associations have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP board of directors loses an eye in case of accident
the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reported several reports , according to a fall in July , the left eye lost .
during the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out onto the street - that he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ eck &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issu@@ ance ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

constitutional Complaints ( BvR ) ( Number of result : 2 )
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have defini@@ tively sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing to the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem 11 at the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place from the tribe of Roman Br@@ ass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he exercises at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised the World Champion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europe League games , Tu@@ chel let Tu@@ chel be open .
with a high probability , it will also match the second game .
the for@@ ceful statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the Fin@@ al@@ ein@@ zug must be the goal for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League holds Julian Wei@@ gl : &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead a pioneering role in Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a pioneer in changing the cars of technological superi@@ ors .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jam , &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who will also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid conversion to digital radio .
for testing new technology , a test track is currently being built on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be br@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; verify the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use it internationally to raise the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
when automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless dangerous vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are expected to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organisation Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not count on it in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonom@@ ously driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the current status of the title fight , Düsseldorf , Düsseldorf , wants to take only one single step from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision shall be dropped on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo has been missing , and we have become Europe champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the fifth @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they are wearing the spectacular creations of the French designer who became the big star of the fashion scene , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om side@@ walk To The cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from 18 September to the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit to death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it concerns tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was done : to fr@@ o the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have made 14 tons of material .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ely fashionable secret attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the dra@@ fting of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
for his first fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make a difference .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips arose in a large amount for customers who worked on them for example to blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ ist@@ itze .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the tip of the tip , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and at regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past styles , is an increasing order potential .
who does not use any niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ ist@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales were broken away .
private shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
nowadays , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively over chains .
it also weak@@ ens exports , currently to Russia and in the United States .
so there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association also seeks to score with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially responsible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and tips .
to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why an existing design is often only slightly different to hold a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine sti@@ ck@@ les small chi@@ cks in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ ma Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI push@@ es to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wider to the outside in order to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was t@@ asked with the reform of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should engage in attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the central leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new start @-@ ups to promote and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to control the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that do not come into question for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , since it has a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , which guarantees the market more open and open to the market , said the statement .
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how they manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus increase consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received a corresponding paper paper on the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons , &quot; are raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
big predat@@ ory fish , however , are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries such as car@@ p tend to be so low that they already comply with the planned peak values .
