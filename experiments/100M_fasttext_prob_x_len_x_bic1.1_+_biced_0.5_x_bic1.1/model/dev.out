Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the meeting , however , it should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution that is being discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu wanting a lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal signed by Obama on the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had been rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend has been shot dead
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hours .
he said that Lamb made the fatal distress call sometime thereafter .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university that forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and collabor@@ ators who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal background .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problemati@@ cal behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he was also a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
he had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he received his doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long @-@ time friend@@ ships Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time he was the women &apos;s flock .
all the girls were melted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together with one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and j@@ esting with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the congregation at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the University Choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Writ@@ ers E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency when he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us is planning to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it was planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season of 2014 , some 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it will begin in this month with job interviews and the number of employees from October to December will rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to furn@@ ish shops with employees who sell , distribute and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated wire and a length of arms away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had premi@@ ered 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ str@@ it@@ tig the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected theaters in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN Chief once again ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member Nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC@@ K and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp &apos;s staying power and start dropping their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Mc@@ Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ can re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
only two out of ten would say they were &quot; upset &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ can sees Tru@@ mp Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , said ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first Pre @-@ voting State of the Nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not enter the White House so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they raise their scholarship holders , Republi@@ can voters keep Tru@@ mp for real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four from ten end of July put their money to J@@ eb President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination over only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters can view the Tru@@ mp campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp leadership while anti @-@ trust support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can Can@@ did@@ ates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Ch@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead Walker 15 points , ahead of Walker Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp @-@ fans say they have formed their opinion .
a recent C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp say that they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say to never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 Republi@@ can re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; two months ago in his election campaign , immigration was a turning point in the public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems that Donald Tru@@ mp seems to be doing too .
the fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new levels .
meanwhile , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey conducted by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ishly angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a street can@@ opy costs an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places , however , the price is similar to pe@@ an@@ uts .
Engel &amp; Völ@@ ker &apos;s real estate service provider has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousand Euros nix - per square meter , noted .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ cont@@ actor in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one race .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have brought a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; in the wit@@ ches &quot; essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick game in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where in the third country Guardi@@ ola wants to finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ potent t to Munich .
in his 28th matches in the Champions League to the Bavaria leadership , Müller received a good result from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart MEP Roberto , who had a flan@@ ked shot of the World Champion .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word .
they showed a concentrated and committed vision without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six games in the top class , including clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran bol@@ dly in their offensive efforts , but often too in@@ ventive .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper part of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
at first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stur@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Polish header ( 26th ) .
then by direct calling the keeper Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians gra@@ bbed their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set needle sticks .
but Tor@@ eke@@ eper Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
for example , when he drew a shot from the idea of the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Guardi@@ ola defended a four @-@ chain @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , sat outside first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the ailing Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , using El@@ f@@ meter Müller made even one .
before the game , it was at the stadium of Kra@@ v@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and attacked the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern fan was wounded from the stadium .
those who smoke have a higher risk of losing their teeth
those who smoke will not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
the good news : in case of ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is based on the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of pre@@ mat@@ urely losing their teeth in order to increase the 2.6 to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of dental loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent inflammation of the g@@ ums in smokers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not clear whether smoking increases the risk of tooth decay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the threat goes back to the level of non @-@ smokers , &quot; said Er@@ du@@ el Thomas Dietrich of the Birmingham University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health down to the old age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 has been affected by non @-@ tooth loss .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists rep@@ el lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity on Cologne &apos;s Rhine bank
archaeological finds have been made in Cologne for the repeated time on the right bank of the Rhine .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have dug up , said Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Arch@@ ae@@ ological Natural Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower there is also a cemetery with around 350 graves which probably belonged to the church .
young woman of freight train captured
after a young woman has died at the railway station in Gei@@ oll@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the population for help .
on Wednesday morning , around 1.@@ 40 a.m. the woman crossed the railway station and reached the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
by recording the train , according to the Federal Police , she suffered severe injuries .
she was emergency medical treatment on site and brought to a hospital by rescue workers .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal railway crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the intermedi@@ ary function@@ aries .
the incident could possibly have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by by Lin@@ der@@ ner railway , Bri@@ ck@@ ey@@ cher trail , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question .
critics concerning the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock and given free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under Phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute on TTIP
in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de intends to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people is to be created through the TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US can jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a second instance is provided for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against rul@@ ings .
up to now , the parties involved agreed among themselves to arbit@@ ers , there was no possibility of objection to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term she wants to work on an international investment court .
there , for example , there could also resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) required mainly by major corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary to break down damages of tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act identified the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
on the other hand , the German state Secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , described the plans as great progress .
the Commission took into account fundamental issues in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association Business Europe warned against limiting the economy &apos;s legal action by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is deemed to be no longer sustainable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens was sitting on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ tip pen .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he talks about different places , which he repeatedly records on the map , wor@@ rying about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were created and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fted into the great opul@@ ent at any time .
the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an , &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be in a row .
but already in 2004 and in the vicinity of the Rhine there has already been &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; and has positive expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .

a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ite You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , 2005 will be a nationwide celebrated masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ rowing on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs have gone up , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and big lumin@@ escent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring in Germany as part of a five @-@ piece band .

although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the v@@ ein@@ ous St@@ ev@@ ens back to the in@@ timacy and folk music returns .
without saying a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n debut at the Fra@@ cture of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister Fra@@ cture is eag@@ erly awaited
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to be making his debut at the prime minister &apos;s frame and for the first time put on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pre @-@ defined questions shortly after noon , with his performance from the media prob@@ able and the Labour MPs from the neighbourhood .
he called for &quot; less theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has provoked critical criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several newspaper pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in a respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were engaged in differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of women .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour Chan@@ ges act to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pension minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade across the patch box in parliament .
the Labour leader promised another policy statement said that he has ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; and gave him more than 30,000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ m@@ ings are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is subjected to serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of Business Minister , will represent him if he doesn &apos;t participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on the way abroad .
he also had the idea that other colleagues had occasion to speak the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , in order to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Ju@@ dy @-@ Theater &quot; which is often tied to the prime minister &apos;s fragment . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and his position under his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and requires far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose @-@ like according to data that showed a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . at the same time , the FT@@ SE was increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s objective .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most recent assessment of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry stocks were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures show all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that it took $ 2.5 billion by stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had made his assessment for the company rating on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports@@ wear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boss of J@@ D Sports says higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ yel@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs could affect the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A plac@@ ard brings Lebanese to potato @-@ don@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - namely in the potato ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the sparkling &quot; potato instead of don@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television .
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that &apos;s mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Lebanese now has to be registered in the patent office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority .
as much meat and as a lot of potatoes in the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay is not willing to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary understanding of the international community is also good for his customers .
Met@@ a launches soil resistance campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ flu@@ ence
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale Met@@ cash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealer and supplier jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distribute samples in I@@ GA shops and store shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian So@@ ccer League to loyal customers .
it is expected that a further details of its defense strategy will be published on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investment strategy day .
there is a lot of stake in the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shop@@ keepers and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and sell off all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 million revenue per year and Met@@ a 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed cost base , could cost about 13 million US $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operational debt at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equ@@ alize selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through fast @-@ growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refurb@@ ishment programs on El@@ an will grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ i and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserved praise for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious confron@@ tations of Kyr@@ gy@@ i and St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have beat Kyr@@ gy@@ na@@ i and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he beat a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp broke out a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ fted a little into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he &apos;s not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too stern .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into consideration the important preliminary ruling that starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term permanent component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has quickly made the climb to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and he deserves all the critic@@ isms he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary announced the emergency and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegal into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of immigrants gathered in a state of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Ser@@ b officials with ou@@ trage .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were returned from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece were arriving .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc to agree on a common immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the cor@@ rupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not rely on a quick action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency situation called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after finishing a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison cups were used during the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most approaching economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , into a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now police custody and are accused of crimes committed after the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to get there .
about 20 people succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is continuing to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains her face to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the Pres@@ i@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
ever since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some winn@@ ings .
Clinton keeps a big margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections dimin@@ ished .
their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders only res@@ ides here with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a major advantage among the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ election regional elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six percent would not support them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are stronger in those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton , less republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , is the most common answer that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement to deal with the problems and the elec@@ ti@@ bility is also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice @-@ president poses a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do so .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters say that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders their second choice .
if Bi@@ den decides not to candidate for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure decreased by 78 percent last month .
bias is by far a second factor in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about their elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters in the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best rewarded by the three candidates in hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters in the pre @-@ election usually also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
with questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as Minister of Foreign Affairs , most of the democr@@ ats of the prim@@ aries are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not influenced altogether .
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , even though 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent do they see as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them to an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 per cent of the voters over the country see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tru@@ mp get good marks in leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near Donald Tru@@ mp in the country@@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tru@@ mp in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times pol@@ l
the two candidates have meanwhile half the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose their hold dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son shot at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son arrives in a good way in demographic groups and runs Tru@@ mp under Republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen down the lowest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the poll@@ s - he lands with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a car@@ son rising in the past week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for questioning Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant swimming @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is at present up to 29 degrees warm .
even though peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , informs the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
by contrast , bath temperatures also offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student passed a student service in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student passed murder charges against five people .
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became power@@ less and allegedly warned one hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide and set the good of the Brotherhood in general about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g has been repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment due to murder of the third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ment and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest is coming , and the house@@ work is becoming wan@@ ing , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
hence , representatives of the US Central Bank strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could notice that the whole fuss was perhaps exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; the first rise in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets are depreci@@ ated 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after F@@ ed &apos;s interest increases .
more specifically , the market has in the past 35 years mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 % ) , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on investment will start to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases frequently promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that it did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is very not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases since 1950 only accounted for twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect it to continue and anticipate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest increases in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants spent the whole year on a net increase in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC can approve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent chance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ öh@@ en very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest maintained by the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates interest rate increase , and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in stocks when they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond leaders immediately fell , the Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher earnings , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interesting is Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit lines have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
large and large enterprises , which handle the larger part of their business operations in the US , will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts will be worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly this will take place .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives member Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name for The Br@@ its .
so , if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director Director rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music , which is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey ar@@ gues that harder work must be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports , got under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show by the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not very distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our own stall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it started a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to include the order of further series of The Voice in the future , or give money to the fee @-@ maker for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose the slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issue in November
for more than a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there is now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now this oscill@@ ates , and we may see that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some retailer sites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could stop buying purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca by crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia reli@@ eves the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane r@@ ushed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane fell to Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mosque .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the stretch to pay their respects when the first of the dead began their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed on to the Holy Site , where only days before a building crane through the veil of the mosque and then on the bed r@@ ushed .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king ordered a san@@ ction from Bin Laden &apos;s construction company for the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 min@@ ers who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the p@@ add@@ ess will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to go to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the arm of the crane than it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was co @-@ responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company is prohibited foreign travel .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , falling into a courtyard of the Great mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ uted the group because of not current safety measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround m@@ ec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials arranged that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same sum of permanently wounded .
other injured get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss tells that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British are increasingly busy cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has risen sharply
this means that 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which target professional tra@@ des@@ people , are opened .
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes
if you can deal with a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
because Br@@ its employ more and more tra@@ des@@ people to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers jobs in their houses , according to the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who has the chain of building markets , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , who offer services at low prices , has meanwhile out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that focus on cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople and to close 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are hit by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying items by women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group trained the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Higher Court of K@@ lagen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball Vice President A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ giving .
the defend@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of office abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted from this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary investigation , the defend@@ ants were mon@@ eti@@ zed in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 to mon@@ ies from club accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact divided the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen .
the sports officials had only charged compens@@ ations and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , came out of the debt - the Passi@@ va amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; at that time , we faced the situation : do we continue or block the club ? , &quot; said one of the accused , in the profession of a large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the financial office .
with his co @-@ workers and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have given money to put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , no debt can be made .
furthermore , with the appropriate financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expense reimbur@@ s@@ ements was decided retro@@ actively by 1991 .
for this reason , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
as a result , l@@ ump formwork and not detailed contracts seemed to have appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and savings books jointly administered the two accused , the second defend@@ ant said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdraw@@ als have not been disclosed to the association in detail , asked the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association didn &apos;t care in detail for the financial support , it was just the debt free , the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , when an official investigation of official ab@@ uses started , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were back@@ rests , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know how to answer this question for a long time .
then he said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims settlement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why claim compensation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the function@@ ary said that he never paid a cent salary , he only reck@@ oned mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
he added 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
precise documents for the early years were not indic@@ ative of the accused .
these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything was considered correct , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
all the movements are done in cash , so he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing was continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ umes another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been ongoing for three years , the computer grid will reduce further jobs when it spl@@ its the company .
the sub@@ missions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 locations in its corporate customer division .
this will save costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be affected by the fourth quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50@@ 5,000 jobs that have been running for three years have not yet been completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share declined by 2.3 percent .
the company that has grown up with printers in Pal@@ o Alto , California , is currently split up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led into a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer for Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
as a result , revenue declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted quite late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and more and more businesses do the same online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS education mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly encounter opposition : 54 percent said appro@@ ving , 35 percent said appro@@ ving .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , find 61 percent positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad would reject 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , and 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 per cent did not decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
at the heart of the fair , connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled automobil@@ es and electro@@ mobility will be at the centre of the exhibition until September 27 .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday .
the wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
like two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA car association expect about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : erup@@ tion of violence at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed tear gas and water @-@ lights on the Serbian border with several hundred rejected refugees at the border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of force at the border control point .
he told the telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it was a police line and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water @-@ laun@@ cher ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the function@@ aries started to put pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
in this way the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn somewhat .
a pregnant woman and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried .
other refugees sank into themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time to decide on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves if the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether or not for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surve@@ yed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and hold the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
letter of De@@ aths to the Delta State University leaves debt write @-@ free
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that police must send police to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no explanation for his shots &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb travelled 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she is &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that he called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University as his life @-@ law on the University &apos;s website .
stars lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this surely requires its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
the Group restructuring will cost 150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1,000 executives cost @-@ effectively .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and valu@@ ing equity capital Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the objective of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year from cost and proceeds syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business in future .
the cheap airline of Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future , Dr. Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Executive Board of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new setup , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
so far , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 associates has been a complex undertaking .
the airlines operate under the roof of the airline airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ffs with the pilot @-@ certificate cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations after the court @-@ pun@@ ched strike are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday .
that was what the union dealt with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wanted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline resulted in several strikes over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa vou@@ ches for the Group &apos;s own cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left external def@@ ender to weeping and excluding him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it has very hard and then plays fant@@ astically , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ ess .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
related to this event : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England Defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very serious injury , that is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very bad at that . I &apos;m so sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely David Cameron knows better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message we &apos;ve missed . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead returns an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text submitted by Cameron reads as part of the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of the Virgin @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ly , r@@ att@@ ling creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said the text probably came from Camer@@ oon &apos;s election circuit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ oon &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a down@@ right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear any scar@@ ring of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
this news : Adam Ly@@ th is eliminated from the England test squ@@ ad and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark on Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the course of Ly@@ th had been extended , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully ki@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton won nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which really hit us .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ punch and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I did nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een maybe did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he managed three hundred re@@ els immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up @-@ sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he was very impressed as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clu@@ e additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful dedication to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made of light hearted .
Bre@@ x@@ it ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain out of the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u if the economy gets into a dol@@ drums by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ declared new negotiating strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU will go deeper every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y . &quot; is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which is viol@@ ently breaking up because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ und said recently that some member states are so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of its own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers are climbing on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European boy@@ friend , who wants an outside UK looking outside within the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
German cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long har@@ ren@@ ders like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will get a leg out to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process suspect my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won &apos;t gain anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street could be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not supported during Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ an &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ hack@@ ers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found out that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , for Bla@@ ir had put the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back door for him .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to waste time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s official position in Europe - I just press it in a friendly way - in the development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wild relatives of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everybody .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea as a shadow Chancellor .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but to fight to &quot; remain under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties according to all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right not to give Cameron a free map for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ - economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which Nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic con@@ ten@@ tions .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities about Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - in order to make concessions to the British , if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , whereby I was reminded of something at the start of Monday of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise public health report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Property Rights Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which P@@ he justified his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people called to develop a model for multi@@ disciplinary decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports beforehand by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarette champi@@ ons , some of whom also provide industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he took part in the meeting .
the research work of the group &quot; acknowled@@ ges that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been premature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison with tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .

BBC should give up East@@ ender , says former leader of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ender and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ fought time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee as part of its investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as much support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ calendar is another ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
honestly , other channels would give her right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m trying to see how this public television should be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC is to blame for the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former Head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart L@@ ecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ ers should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where rather the audience can &apos;t measure , but they carry out their tasks and they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions for justification of 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you think all , we all think that for £ 150 a year you get a great value here , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 a lot , wonder if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check out , educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , educ@@ ating and discussing this in the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers will enter alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled from out@@ bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultrasound waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , cardiac and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms generally do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fied the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when using ultrasound for the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass through un@@ hin@@ dered tissue and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus are able to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

one of the par@@ o@@ dy displays produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists engage with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they must go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapon trade posters gre@@ ets commuters on the underground .
the Am@@ nesty @-@ video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works as a non @-@ profit artist with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist , who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the weapons fair - by a stand@@ by of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; realistic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger with bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the trade fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors get fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in halls of residence
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still in faith in prayer and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have upset - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence ranges from slightly nerve @-@ descri@@ p@@ tive to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sh@@ ew : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand with respect to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and those fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let humans do it .
people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into beverage recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress and put their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ stroll @-@ culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you must go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is tired of convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my students &apos; homes had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve made you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to chat and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people getting sleep@@ y when you tap .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of mil@@ let for your tea also ?
check with the dairy owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my sympathy , but try to deal with a more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added a washing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the true sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it seemed to them to give them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep for two hours before she left their own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , if you are a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , it would not be too embarrass@@ ing for you to take part in her , dis@@ connect and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she draws together all common friends .
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good coup is funny , but it only takes moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but don &apos;t stap@@ le their possessions at the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ fle@@ dged , low @-@ ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses in Central Fran@@ con@@ ia for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the single mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build affordable and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ ler believes to know how quickly cheap living space can be created : he builds row houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gil@@ ler , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
in view of the flow of refugees , we need enough living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
Guil@@ d : a town@@ house needs the least amount of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees say that it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ bert : I have dra@@ fted my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch ordin@@ ance .
sp@@ oo@@ ky .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their town@@ house project ?
guil@@ ders : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but don &apos;t you intensi@@ fy the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the poor @-@ ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build a cheap and good way even today .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the adjustment app , to &quot; General &quot; type and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message stating that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to wait either until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean clearing apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely through the sli@@ mming of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the telephone may be stopped mid@@ way and may result in a demo@@ lition of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , so the membership number increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the sponsor of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation to counter@@ act the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot record the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

district office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ín founded themselves under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as health insurance or services for health and care insurance companies .
for many years now , we have established our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions there .
&quot; in addition , many services of the insurance companies are not seldom used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health care and wellness .
for this the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment can be util@@ ised .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other ideally .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Senior Centre for Care and Care &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is the demographic change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite to a regular soci@@ able presence . &quot;
this gives the social foundation a large contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and in their familiar environment as much as possible .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Satur@@ days from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus was announced on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus was an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most significant architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the out@@ cry .
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .

parking penalty : Tim Wiese charges a polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
former foot@@ b@@ aller Tin@@ Wiese is un@@ noticed in Bremen .
once upon a time , Tim Wiese , ex @-@ nation@@ al@@ keeper in Germany and Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim is engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
he did not intellectu@@ ally oppose it .
meadow had just cut the hair in the center of the Bre@@ mer inner city when he saw a parking guard sent out for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
as a result , Wiese was stor@@ ming from the shop , insul@@ ting the public officials , and throwing off the fine fine of money in front of the feet , as the &quot; picture &quot; newspaper reports .
with the city of Bremen , the alle@@ gations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I decide whether the meadow will be displayed or not .

men beating about 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters according to the police , and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men now scre@@ amed the young people and struck this with the fist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim inherited a nose @-@ leg and ble@@ ed heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the bat , he left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and drove past demonstr@@ atively several times .
when the car was no longer seen , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
with the help of a stick pitch , one applied to the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .

Dr. Frank Müller takes practice field breaks and has invested 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen .
also joint @-@ mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic suppor@@ ter U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert also look forward to this .
in many places in the country there are no doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the field of field stops on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stan@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side with half a job over the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he has invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was a lot of sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ lows met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently completing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den hospital and who also want to get into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the land@@ owners would fit into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was so far I just called her . &quot;
the couple had the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also sees himself as an advantage to be his own boss .
and so one was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ time father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior emergency doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in voluntary work at the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19th , the practice is being prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stopp@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the land@@ owners , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as general practitioners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion the rooms look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need more subscri@@ ber rooms .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 50,000 Euros is given to the mil@@ ler as part of a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euros ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the Lord Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come to the field of field stops every quarter , in North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another office practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fiel@@ stops in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had found himself , it would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers &quot; consultation hour , inci@@ dentally , continues to look forward to familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the medical profession has practiced for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Pen@@ si@@ gh@@ ausen re@@ members smiling .
after a long time she sen@@ sed a bit of melanch@@ oly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live further in Hohen@@ mol@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the activ@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds laughing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have always pushed myself against gardening , now it could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and enjoys travelling .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also ramp@@ ed at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - denied Slovenia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also leave coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see , however , in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants not to shut its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly hit in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also being used .
in the coming days , his country comp@@ etes with some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were diver@@ ted to Croatia at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Belgrade government , however , denied that it was to guide people in adop@@ ting specific routes : &quot; we can neither , nor will we do this , &quot; he said .
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the way all night from the approximately 500 kilometer distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the predicted shift of the former Balkan @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary could indeed come to a somewhat further west @-@ west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed earlier that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptions to the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call for details , but indicated that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive control options for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since consistently issued a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to continue travelling to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Minister of the Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried Wednesday morning to calm the local eye in Hor@@ gos : he cau@@ tions the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment it would not be about very high refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous , however : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard of a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of providing insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ers and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der business should have been made in the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were rel@@ aun@@ ched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 further accused continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are to have acted both in the USA and in Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce in Mannheim for 20 years
there is a busy operation around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their err@@ ands , partly with fast pac@@ ing , sometimes comfortably walking .
you control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
puls@@ ating , pr@@ all life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large tables each with the head@@ line &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce helped with this action to mark its 20th anniversary and is well faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks , such as the voluntary workers .
while some pass@@ ant @-@ by spontaneously reaches the chal@@ k and affir@@ ms the sentence &quot; My life , &quot; &quot; can read , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only if I realize that for me sometime the end comes to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ ash Association carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe .
therefore , this public action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
however , it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate on the tables , but it is a very personal thing .
the issue of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people .
an assessment shared by An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the funeral and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce looked for honor by calling an honorary citizen , she immediately reported and was involved in the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and family members in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they all have been carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and the experiences and experiences made there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another department , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as further training and supervision of death and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ants .
courses for new employees are offered every two years .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
also there can be recorded additional personal wishes on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
analysts predicted a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect comes despite the price increases aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , despite higher charges for bo@@ d@@ ular transport of heavy and large packages which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year as a result of cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS who plans to recru@@ it 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ ack &apos;s investment research analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the analysts surve@@ yed by Z@@ acks were $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express delivery to stagn@@ ating .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in bo@@ d@@ ular transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in cargo business .
in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected session in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spending two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at one end of the decorated two @-@ story session hall there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and it is also just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the agency Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rates , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which poll@@ utes the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently surve@@ yed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
however , the financial markets wait for the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the share market , if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts reduce the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets in order not to panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that it would be necessary more economic progress would expect an increase in the proposition .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world ended up at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that slow@@ down the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , with the Dow decl@@ ines almost 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation as to when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed became the currency authority in the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
the mere indication of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion triggered del@@ u@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only super@@ v@@ ise developments elsewhere but also talk to other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
varnish , vo@@ iced member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a rise in interest rate , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its lead by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled the cuts .
the F@@ ed should address aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 Market Survey , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement at Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a price increase because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not possible without the engagement of innumerable volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ ein .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is completely different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ oric intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ina sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ out of gymnas@@ tics at the Bern@@ ina Sport@@ complex is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without any major discussions .
before that , the committee had , among other things , decided to apply for a legal &quot; exception &quot; of &quot; respect &quot; and &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the current development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be constructed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned use of the roof area for solar installations is the background of the planning : &quot; this way we get together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the case of &quot; liberation &quot; it was about the ti@@ lt that is intended for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan stipul@@ ated - below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan permitted no &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of roof ti@@ lt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project in gymnas@@ tics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tude sport promotion .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now submitted to the Board of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
the Supervisory Board , however , will make a decision on this decision on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further In@@ ner Station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees were informed of the plans .
the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who was prepared to take over the leadership and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of 1 October .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
for the next two years , if the supervisory board agrees to that , both houses will lead until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ella , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this in 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Land@@ Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , came to meet the rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I exclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has worked as head physician for over 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ balls of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Löwen are required this evening ( 8@@ pm ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .
although the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason to arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season , the bad@@ ener faced a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and got something good there .
Jag@@ om@@ incident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed .
after firing a shot , a man of 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old suffered serious injuries and were put into hospitals .
it was unclear how exactly this could lead to the accident .
the police are investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old who had been missing from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz since Saturday .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old began to kill the youths and threw their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old missing from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz has fallen victim to a crime of violence since Saturday .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police announced on Wednesday .
as indeed suspi@@ cious , a 20 year old , likewise arrested on Tuesday evening , was indeed conf@@ essed and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the body .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they had not come home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators first met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the arrest was reported to the authorities to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the body in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be brought to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him in charge .
the further investigations are intended to shed light on the circumstances of the matter .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more and more refugees are looking for affordable housing .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
distribution competitions on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study on behalf of the association agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
thus 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer committed to living as an asylum seek@@ er in an initial accommodation .
many run into the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , less than half of all asylum seekers have been living for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also highlights significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing development policy of recent years .
Germany is going to slide out an apartment deficit that will grow from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ ,000 residential units have been missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many professionals emig@@ rated in large cities into flat @-@ share rooms .
young adults remained un@@ intentionally longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the calm of the apartment market .
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction .
in this way , the real estate tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats could be suspended for a limited period .
in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are needed , according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
a good week after the launch , at 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the currently available around 300 million euros have been called up .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
there is practically no passing through to Hungary , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing its entry via Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the sh@@ ot@@ ting of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the TV channel RT@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary had closed its border on the eve of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new laws that came into force the same day also make decent asylum procedures practically superf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the Serbian border to the neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id with both the bus and the taxis .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Serbian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet border f@@ ences .
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 registered people .
shortly before the closing date on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws establish the overcoming and damage of the border area as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condemned rebu@@ ke prison sentences of up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit Mountains &quot; which were established on the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees there .
practically no one has a chance to get granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
locking grids were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austria will only reach a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants were still in the country , according to government data .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the on@@ ward journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , small groups of refugees gathered regularly on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because on Sunday , but because of the influ@@ x of refugees on Sunday , Germany had unexpectedly stopped rail traffic with Austria , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames with two further hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
before that , we used the unexpected guests only once , with snacks and drinks .
we said straight away , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded rail passengers had switched from an ICE train to a regional train in W@@ els on Sunday evening , in order to get to Germany after the announcement that rail traffic was stopped after Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able , day before a two @-@ b@@ lower course sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately at the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our German Chancellor has officially and openly moved the stance of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees too will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing floods and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for those seeking protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ proof quarters
Konrad has all his hands to do with the support of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has set up the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ ban@@ ker to set up qu@@ arti@@ s for the thousands of refugees .
Con@@ rad has already got a grip on the chaos at the first trading center in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the placing of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday is without great fuss , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; masterpiece . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 districts last year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the country , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a wet ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the country &apos;s cent@@ uri@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him to create quarters for the forthcoming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , where it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations also into the ORF production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter .
yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors have to comply with a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the tops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad was reas@@ oned with his experience that in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior he was more successful in accommodation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Con@@ rad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic any cost as they themselves asser@@ ted .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
his own quest for torture has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planned by the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment because those affected can &apos;t be accommod@@ ated without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
criticism of the city chief at the allocation of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not regulated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday cor@@ ded further proceedings in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not regulated .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be no more special deals with refugees in Germany for the time being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guards , however , were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a logical consequence for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Industrial Line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is moved to S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies in the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also acquiring some of them .
from the very beginning S &amp; T intends to co @-@ operate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
EUR 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million Euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is rented from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to be postpon@@ ed by Li@@ a Per@@ oni &apos;s 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she now gained an increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and appar@@ el from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz cant@@ een that sells this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why , when looking at a hand@@ bag , some woman will not be able to answer with the last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag inv@@ okes every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this feature with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign language , as regards journalists or reveals gaps in knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office stimulates the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ eh@@ e@@ eats is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant village is related to it over ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del shot a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ sel shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , among whom besides Tru@@ mp the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz ranks among them .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
inci@@ dently loud the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in Hoch@@ deutsch : the investors , she says .
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation of the real estate company was the first real estate purchase in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once cut off without permission , had declared the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , for the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; just like the Polish , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the walt@@ z in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so dev@@ out . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp comes ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the guesthouse owner Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not know the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the Sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ o@@ cher Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Austrian Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alp@@ inist village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the ratings for today .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , put in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals compared with today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today reported a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
in September , Sun@@ rise will have an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today &apos;s Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these dawn more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recent weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily defeated The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) le@@ aped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ seed average 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail around 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that did not manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki , may unknow@@ ingly have apparently who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , who finally lands at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows a day before out of three two , you might accidentally put an indication on who will be the vic@@ tor .
Sam W@@ oods heads up his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have ly@@ rical expression about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should win W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; their answers could become a game @-@ cor@@ rup@@ ting , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
each Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly called both - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with her feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam W@@ oods would be well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s visit to the house made her clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw it with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set without reservation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies against the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Hay@@ ne also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers sports re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only care for the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Salon in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not so many new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; otherwise we will get commerci@@ als in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Parliament fraction of the free vot@@ er days until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , quite different main themes were planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Pre @-@ voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the Yugosla@@ v Wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free vot@@ er as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more agile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt shouldn &apos;t fall under the table .
a long @-@ time favourite remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , cultural minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Medium @-@ stage plus &quot; ( CS@@ U ) at 47 Gym@@ na@@ sia , where an extension of the upper @-@ secondary middle stage is tested for three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to finish .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after police shooting on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot down rubber stories in a crowd which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ zi@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had assembled outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they resor@@ ted to rubber bum@@ ps .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber stories which are known to kill them , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high rate of death .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ onn@@ i would say that new provinces being formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have quick@@ ened the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 sq@@ . m area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market some 4,000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the youth center Alte Post .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
it is planned to use the area for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
which investor question comes into question is not yet clear .
no contracts had yet to be signed .
the town of Em@@ den had already bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , already bought some months ago and the building is torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea in Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
a number of newcom@@ ers are still worried - they fear the sale of their recreational activities
months passed behind closed doors , sal@@ uted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday resort near Em@@ den are lying on the table .
the interested person , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ der Council .
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investors and management sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project has been in discussion for months , which is about ten to twelve million Euros .
strong reactions among the owners of the sea , who had come to the meeting , drew up the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , marine owner and member of the board of advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ ders , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant leap that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears as many other project critics that the traffic would greatly increase by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end@@ lessly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled to Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey includes many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately look for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four char@@ itable organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / subscri@@ ptions have been doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes live longer after losing weight loss than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an edi@@ t@@ orials to the new J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery study .
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity @-@ related operations for type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I of over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cers - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those who underwent this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus disappeared completely and at 28 % in some cases .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes decreased completely only in one percent and partly in only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood levels of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host @-@ rec@@ tomy @-@ group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.7 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soothing for individuals with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is currently attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tibetan Buddhism leader urged to stop violence in the home countries of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics in studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama promised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of taking hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the last 4 years
the US poison control centers report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who so@@ ar strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection , &quot; says Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of dis@@ infection of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 , which report toxic control centres , increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said some children intentionally drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ating in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection products only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ infection products with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that &apos;s bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very attractive for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
few sp@@ lashes of alcohol pois@@ oning can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially in infants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume plenty of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry @-@ sc@@ ented disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is illegal in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah missed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ eine &quot; teachers by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the vain plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and demonstrated disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
at a rear @-@ end collision at the cross @-@ gap between Nordr@@ ing and On Her@@ pes , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver has been slightly injured during a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross@@ road towards the industrial area and was too late to see that two approaching vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he mounted his truck into the rear of an audi@@ tor and sh@@ ook the vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta that was standing before .
there was a damage of about 10,000 euros in the vehicles involved in the accident , sharing the police with them .
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Audi was no longer ready to ride and had to be tow@@ ed off .
rum@@ or @-@ ups : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic

Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ season gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , making the D@@ ons a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team comrades are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ middle @-@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they have no more highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic struggles have to fight , but the Norwegian chef has s@@ ware to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following exit from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen , who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel this right , but we must go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
war@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously at January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , he pointed out that he ha@@ sten@@ ed a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Kay@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ CEO of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season period to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic @-@ target person Mich@@ u with reference guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract expi@@ red with the sw@@ ans .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ amt that his team of Aber@@ deen was desper@@ ately struggling against Hamilton Heights to see a seventh consecutive league win , which gave them a lead of five points before Celtic on the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in cups or le@@ agues that have not won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom it is growing overall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the 5.5 % U@@ K@@ s , as shown by the figures of the Bureau for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I Will Be Wit@@ ness to an Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I shall see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since there are often more applications available than places , there is a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a report by Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to mention all the details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his acts after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot claim to be really obj@@ ectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after the hunt for police persec@@ ut@@ ors persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; persu@@ ade him sof@@ tly to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called to a home peace event in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria attempted to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching from Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Cob@@ alt sound sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months for the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up with raised head , and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had the bomb explo@@ ded in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behaviour and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and inf@@ ringe me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the level of fru@@ stration levels of the trainer has been set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied slu@@ dge to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like this night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was the same on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy is beating against ri@@ vals for claims about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favorite of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the storm @-@ players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hard @-@ disgu@@ ised remark on the Storm Team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tac@@ kling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of his team and said that they are only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers at his team was confident that they were worried that they would be beaten up by the storm team .
&quot; this repeatedly shows up - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about struggles when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ cles into a real focus , and that has proved the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny that this time of the year will come up again and again .
at Bell@@ amy , Benn@@ etts has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premi@@ ership in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us it means that we will meet them in a single phase .
the storm team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the pre @-@ final at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery
a man who may have a life @-@ long punishment due to his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ accused in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 Dollar as security in order to achieve his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements by the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his / her Australian and Serbian passport , reports daily at the police and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tear@@ ing apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried to avoid in the last moment to move to the left as the police did .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident victim was torn apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours until 2 am .
damages amoun@@ ting to EUR 12@@ 2,000 were incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone used by girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , lo@@ aned in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone lack@@ ed and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and aler@@ ted her mother immediately .
the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; Web searches that used words for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Ho@@ gg claimed to have done it as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it was happening because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the defend@@ ant used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked a lot younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent photos taken by children on the 14th of June last year , to have viol@@ ated the obligations and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
Gregor S@@ im appe@@ aled that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the sexual offen@@ se register , argu@@ ing that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the sentence by October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted b@@ ail in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
smu@@ dges devi@@ ate from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken away from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river border river Inn in the district of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and dam@@ s on the German side .
there they are received by federal police and for@@ warded to the registration .
in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday at Munich Central Station , significantly more refugees arrived on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 8 am , some 700 people had arrived in the state capital , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the Sou@@ thwest on Wednesday afternoon .
the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart , which currently holds hot sea air , flows into the country because of a low pressure zone on Western Europe .
the strong low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm , Henry , who was dra@@ gged over the Atlantic over the past few days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to the DW@@ D , up to Thursday night also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ sea circle with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 h @-@ kilometers can be reck@@ oned .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass makes it : every two years , the car manufacturers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is mainly moving among the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : roughly 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations have been accounted for by the Swiss Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the major premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel makes a start at the top of the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17,@@ 650 Euro .
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen also offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / 200 hp , among which also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is available only as a five @-@ door model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Me@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan subscri@@ ber wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) , according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers put their hand at the front end : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
the inf@@ otain@@ ment system has been modernis@@ ed in the interior , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrating Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the raised Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ prisoner at the prison facility of Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the judges can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that the man , who , according to the information of his lawyer , was now on his free foot@@ ing , had been transferred to a larger cell .
as a result of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the State of Berlin , his term of office failed .
but the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the judgment of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and rejected the case for re @-@ examination there .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comb erg@@ eri@@ cht now decides about the amount of compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention were decisive for compensation , a lev@@ elling sentence was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear of the privacy of the personality would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often reinforced the rights of prisoners of convic@@ ts .
so they did not speak to a prisoner in April because he was locked up naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multi @-@ layer assignment of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy of human dignity .
in addition to this , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday that had an in@@ humane detention during a Par@@ allel incident in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 to 21 hours a day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had been hit by the head@@ lines in recent weeks because of lack of staff .
for this reason , det@@ ain@@ ees are en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed again and again for 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even in case of h@@ ass@@ ings , it has already happened because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ platz , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of young talent , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
according to vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to S &amp; D vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do that and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming up in Germany conve@@ ys the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are used annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing , but especially for affordable rental properties , is dramatic : every year , 60,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units fall out of the hire price bond , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is far too little from the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view : 80@@ ,000 social housing per year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
the researchers and the Federal Minister of Development agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualification in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial to find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researchers Dietrich Ober@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to the decree , there was a political shift : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to the recognition of labour .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as well as the residence requirement that restric@@ ts asylum seekers to a residence .
in the society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - the point of view has become increasingly enforced by the fact that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
a large barrier for access to the labour market is missing knowledge of the German language .
so far there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the establishment of networks is the king &apos;s path to work integration in the opinion of Thr@@ es@@ hardt .
the school administration in Berlin stated that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ es , an estimated ten to fifteen percent : &quot; it is only important for the de@@ wor@@ med parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ z@@ lau@@ dable , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators increase strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
students are prepared in the countries without knowledge of German in their welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , even by teachers who only have qualifications in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ags from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal country forbi@@ ds asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or de@@ ple@@ tion do not receive any services according to the asylum application law when they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , the latter do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the persons entitled to af@@ oot .
tolerated refugees had to have lived four years in Germany to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 this can be shortened to 15 months .
but this funding gap has to be closed , says Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students were asked to get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g at once .
Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state church law will develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it is also important to establish an Islamic Charity Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
duties also belong to the rights .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to lodge in opposition to religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to avoid such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law into Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will continue to be a topic of society in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the majority society will have to change , forcing the elimination of discrimination and racism .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general equality law for nearly a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders show , in the police and authorities , systematically ignor@@ ing the rac@@ ist motive .
same chances for all : what migrants &quot; organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention Germany commit , must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens want to use its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the so far expected refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says doctor @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we do that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needs to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for all newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards immediately .
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the restricted power catalogue that the asylum application law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors generally do the language barriers .
as early as in the past , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are deterior@@ ating worse about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over .
but it would have helped many refugees with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic glance .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more untreated obstruc@@ tions , and in the youth it is about HIV @-@ raising .
but with some other clinical pictures , German doctors tend to come from their training , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , many refugees were even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee children are particularly vulnerable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers , among other things , the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z said .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically sick refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ologically sick asylum seekers in the social welfare offices can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy , but the treatment lasts usually several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new &quot; passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal thres@@ holds and unique entertainment .
now the cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on a brick , was@@ en for dre@@ aming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e@@ gen production .
for more than 33 years , the Cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for am@@ a@@ fici@@ on@@ ados is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gene cocktail with world city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
awarded the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
also the Cas@@ tillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to capture female hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intuition and articul@@ ation .
to balance the wheel on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , how little others and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often a topic for various animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks at it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged Arti@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is read off by the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always do our best and are there with my whole heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst conven@@ es daily from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 : 00 and 20 : 00 .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 pm prices are dis@@ counted .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe positions wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the Falls quickly spread across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the opposition &apos;s statements that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to follow Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as well .
in the last month they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech that he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones who warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the members of Parliament that immunity ends in parliament and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job cuts result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual turnover and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain at the European Championship .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing in the high season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not related to his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of the more than 157 league players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they were one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have suffered most of the injury days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and gain combat power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players that need it a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al has clear favor@@ ites , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger is convinced that Arsen@@ al has won the lesson last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the association to his first European cup triumph with his management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in the business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration : the comedy show , which gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ re@@ piece of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication based on social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , vi@@ gil@@ ant and successful , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much more deeply .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beautiful thing about friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football so@@ cks in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how a staff of telephone counsel@@ ing told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and are self @-@ condemned , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that makes sense when trying to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly shows the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration with the scenery that is completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k ?
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ low Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating his match against Malm@@ ö with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the prince &apos;s par@@ tri@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on his way , but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , because they don &apos;t just strive to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the goal . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret not having scored another or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris @-@ Team after his injury , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw on the weekend in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Mary in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö def@@ enses , before he passed Johan Wil@@ and along nicely into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but apart from a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away on Kevin Tra@@ pps pole in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ passes and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was missing in the first half in less than five attempts , after having used Cav@@ ani after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his team@@ mates into play , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Mary into a shoot , which was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects $ 2.5 billion through share sales
the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is affected by falling commodity prices , accumulated $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge debt settlement plan .
the Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth around £ 1.@@ 6@@ bn to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn push@@ es demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issu@@ ance of subscription rights brought a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning trading .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core last week announced the $ 2.5 billion sale sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to t@@ ase about a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new equity hol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and will reci@@ proc@@ ate President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a state dinner after the two leaders have held bilateral talks .
&quot; President X@@ is visit will provide the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese collaboration with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but also President Obama and President Xi give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i plays for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was apparently shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league winners , four times champion league winners , twice champion world champion , twice World Champion , twice World Champion , the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he stood before the Euro 2008 before the exit from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid has won everything , we have nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to have Romanian sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
remember@@ ing : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this today works for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he has gotten me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns joined X@@ av@@ i in 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , switched the Red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph in the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays down diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives , insi@@ sted on a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then you do it in the filling of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown re@@ acted with offensive un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actors from The Mar@@ tian settled .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer group Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; said Brown first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and she is a s@@ ut@@ te struck by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the producer of De@@ ar White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights in the film ; Dam@@ on said that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was aired , the social media explo@@ ded with dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when exact rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
after the teen@@ age Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s movement grew across the country and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against farmers .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gramm@@ y Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hate groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operating support Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten up to the final .
the last task was climbing at a climbing rope of 75 feet in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked to E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or have lived , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , even though he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful prize and life changes , he gets the great grat@@ u@@ it@@ ousness .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any res@@ ent@@ ment .
he has just been so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting starts in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb up within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild card course .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word , which was so hard to grasp about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inner ring 6 times and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game .
designed tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit play by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung his sleep well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ab@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the kick training , looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three runs at the end of the seventh session , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon introduced his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designed ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who has left the right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the finish Run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double play
after Detroit finally added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner ring , wall made a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed man st@@ ach out S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit became the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game of an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored 3 laps in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing for more than a month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I had wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers set up in the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t hit him very well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch Count and scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ever Gran@@ t A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns in six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z expi@@ red because of an injury to the litter shoulder .
he is examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to fight the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he was missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three matches at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees should perish in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who were involved should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden received on Tuesday evening .
it comp@@ lied with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital were prepared for this event in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily perish .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
over the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse , according to the government pres@@ idents responsible for the first recording .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective path@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , one was glad that the cup of a military involvement has passed to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict comes crashing at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the spot for refugees .
Austria is controlled at the south and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , after Hungary no one will be sent back .
Germany too did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it has been agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an agreement in which Germany could receive a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mr Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , that there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call them concrete figures and pointed to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first intake and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Chancellor Angela Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who would need protection complain this too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort of force . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometer long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could also be brid@@ ged with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking ev@@ asive action over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported that there were thousands of migrants on the way to the Greek border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the Eis@@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sw@@ apped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moon therefore stag@@ gers easily on its way around the ring planet .
although this movement is only small , but still too large for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers are presenting their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of Saturn , which sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers at that time closed .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man .

the person who eats the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then of course they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US package service U@@ PS once again provides up to 9@@ 5,000 help for the Christmas business in the United States .
the company started with the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
drivers are looking for drivers .
last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 help .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year in order to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 delayed deliveries had severe criticism in the parcel service .
first fo@@ eh@@ n tower , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night , the F@@ öhn stops in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night of Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows partly with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ e@@ valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest flow .
on the mountain side of the Alps the F@@ öhn stops through the valleys on the night to Wednesday .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up to Thursday morning in the F@@ ont valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places to the neighbouring centre and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my F@@ öhn provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the Alpine hill@@ side .
here rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter have to be reck@@ oned to the south of the Alps , which has already fallen into large amounts of rainf@@ all over the past few days .
on Thursday morning , the blow dri@@ es out the air , as a result a cold front rolled over Switzerland with a strong , partly wit@@ ty rain from west to east .
together with the cold front the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days are coming north @-@ east@@ erly with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south it is sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now acknowledged as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutscher The@@ ologi@@ an der Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the Pop@@ es City of Pop@@ es were often able to live their faith only in secret societies for centuries .
with the square , it is symbo@@ lically evident that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a deca@@ ying sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
according to historians his negative impressions should have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then introduced the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the dem@@ on @-@ trade .
hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 designs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 year old - but which is by no means equal to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can seem quite dark .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective artist selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to topics like cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
the same applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the scrip@@ tures on the basis of painting .
he has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into the present context . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical quote of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord is golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggered for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family owned by the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; recalls O@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work this up to perhaps also bear me with the Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to restore art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is shaped today by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is sup@@ planted .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall prey &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not pay attention to fully capture the Bible , but also to select the most important , also mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
beginning of construction for BM@@ X train is approaching
plans made , space found , company commissioned to model earth hills for a round course : one year later it was almost all done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was finished .
failures in politics and administration were responsible for the expul@@ sion , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval was to be received in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate with the child and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will still happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; memorial break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga is setting a clear mark on the weekend .
football responds to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its assistance in tac@@ kling the pending problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle that it &apos;s not about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role in this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must put politics .
therefore , the German Football Association has extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Stiftung , we ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts are also supporting this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations place a clear sign when they will wear the im@@ print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s head of sport Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler der &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee tragedy goes on everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do football @-@ federal li@@ gi@@ sts , no , we must use our bril@@ liance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig was talking about a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European qualifying match against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensed copies had started their own projects in their places is great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will each provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of the SAP board losing an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost his left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was almost bloo@@ dless , power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out onto the road - he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday announcement ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fully in my job for SAP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ ds in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus have finally broken down in the first group match of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem eleven on the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change to the door guard position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of St@@ atic Editor Roman br@@ ush@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he exercises at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europe league games in the future , he left the door open .
with a high probability , he will also play the second game .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who will also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy shift to digital radio .
to test new technology there is currently a test track on the expres@@ s@@ way 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks shall be imposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to ensure that the maximum speed allowed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages humans as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany for 20@@ 25 to about 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organisation Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not count at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of the surve@@ yed surve@@ yed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the US .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could well imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well every fourth would not leave the car under any circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing date in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ am@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ elin , who runs the S@@ etz@@ sch@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the World R@@ ank@@ ings Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United had a serious injury to the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a large fashion show and a wax figures sc@@ ary cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highlights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mannequins that look terrible human thanks to video projections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he was hiding men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ached in the past , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which will be seen from 18 September to the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it concerns tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly still @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed complete artwork for which much effort was done : to fr@@ inge the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have taken 14 tonnes of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
also Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashionable attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
his parents could not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the dra@@ fting of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
for his first fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - lace as a fashion niche
it used to be on the long stit@@ ching machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in great quantities for customers , who used them for example to furn@@ ish blankets and she@@ ers .
today , this is no longer working , &quot; says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the &quot; gran@@ ary &quot; P@@ lau@@ en .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the early times of the lace fashion , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is based on past styles , is an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who does not serve any niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they are already doing half of all orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gran@@ ary P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und Sti@@ cker@@ ö &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with nine other companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been cut off .
there is almost no more private trade and wholesale business .
our products barely reach the customers in this way .
nowadays , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently to Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the nitrogen bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; we have been running a quality seal since this year , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially sustainable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialised in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly modified to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine li@@ cks small chi@@ cks in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I could not start with traditional p@@ ints . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
so I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not a re @-@ movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical infant girl .
it is about the experience of n@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI push@@ es to open the economy to the wider world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that has been t@@ asked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of comprehensive reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Xi &apos;an said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a list of negative lists to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population milking system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified which are not eligible for investment .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of great importance as it shows the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legal business environment and is more open to the market , said the statement .
the government will also cur@@ b controls on the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the toxins .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper in the EU , has critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolfgang Sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
big predat@@ ors , however , are so strongly polluted with mercury today that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m .
however , F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries such as car@@ p tend to be so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ all is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore cau@@ tions that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low amounts especially in un@@ born damage of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the maximum values valid , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazards to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet the Green party members Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; long @-@ lasting and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from paper in March .
over the past year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
