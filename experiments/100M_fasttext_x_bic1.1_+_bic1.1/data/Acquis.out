the community and the States appoint two arbit@@ rators , the organization also called two refer@@ ees , and the four refer@@ ees appointed as refer@@ ees elect a fifth arbitr@@ ator .
if the community and the States or the organization have not named two arbit@@ rators within thirty days after the application for an arbit@@ ration , the community or the organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these refer@@ ees .
the same procedure shall apply if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned .
a ) This Convention shall present for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant State of the Organisation noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and
II ) if the Community of the Organization notes that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The Organization , the Community and the States seek one another on the request of one of the contracting parties to am@@ end this Convention .
B ) All changes require the agreement of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The Director General shall promptly inform all Member States of the organisation from any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
a ) This Convention shall enter into force on the day when the Organization of the Community and States receives the written notification that their procedures are completed for entry into force .
B ) This Convention shall remain in force for so long as the States Parties to the contract are .
the term used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol together .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures applicable when implementing the provisions of Section I concerning preventive measures .
the aim of the safety measures set out in this Convention is the timely detection of distributing significant quantities of nuclear activities for nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ heads for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a tur@@ no@@ ff by the risk of early detection .
in order to enrich the target set in Article 28 , the material book@@ keeping is used as a safety measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical completion of the tests by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material that is not proven for a certain period of time is specified indicating the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in performing their audit , the Organization makes use of the safegu@@ arding system of the Community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their preventive measures , the Community shall make use of the procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , see how they are more closely identified and appropriate in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of recovered , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise from the continu@@ ance of distant core material and the quantity of stock ;
( B ) ass@@ essing the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
( C ) procedures for determination , testing and assessment of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedure for ass@@ essing clusters of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which exhibits the core material inventory and changes of this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone , for each material balance zone ;
g ) to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proc@@ eedings for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organisation in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures under this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore treatment .
B ) If the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) has not yet been reached into the States , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves the core material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the States in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The provisions set out in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community believes that recovery of core material , which is subject to preventive measures under this agreement , is temporarily not possible or desirable , so that the organization and the community seek each other through the use of appropriate safety precau@@ tions .
B ) The preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community realise that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
on the request of the Community , the Organization shall exemp@@ t the following core material from the security measures under this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material if it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on the request of the Community , the Organization shall free the core material , which otherwise would be subject to security measures under the present Convention , from these security measures , provided that the total amount of nuclear material delivered in the States under this Article shall not be at any time any more than
a ) a total of one kilogram of special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
( II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if freed core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the safety measures under this agreement , precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ application of the security measures on that material .
the Community meets with the organisation Compl@@ ementary agreements which are required to determine the extent necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organization under this Convention , in detail how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention .
the suppl@@ em@@ ental agreements can be extended or amended without changing the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the suppl@@ em@@ ental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake every effort so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
the organization , based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , constitutes a consolidated inventory of all the core material underlying the security measures of this Convention in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory in accordance with the following reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
( GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imped@@ ed by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent within two years following entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bonds in order to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; Special account &quot; which consists of the funds which the Member States contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement ; this account is referred to by the organization as a ste@@ ward and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and according to the provisions of this agreement .
the transaction account is separated and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the entries are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes issued by the Member State , to pay at the request in the currency of the relevant State at the Order of the Organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the organization of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the Administrator at the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining fee of January 1 , 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Each Member State may be entitled to make payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker accepts approximately proportional conc@@ essions to the cash or the school j@@ ars to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the case of granting this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional capacity to loan to loan terms without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly @-@ payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices applied for the funding funded by the organization .
the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved in the context of a loan or loan for a programme or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special re@@ payment terms are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally applicable for the loan granted by the organization ; therefore , they are ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years each .
special F@@ unds are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this fee must be paid directly to the organization that it retains .
each special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular .
the recei@@ pts from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services made or provided in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and the according to what the car@@ et@@ aker has set at the time of loan guarantee may be bene@@ fici@@ aries of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments from a special transaction loan take place on the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker is instructed by the EW@@ G until all special transaction loans have been awarded for the audit by the directors in preparation and about the plans and programs approved by the directors .
during the time of the payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker informs the EE@@ A quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this purpose .
as soon as possible , the manager conve@@ ys a detailed account of the transaction accounts with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account closure as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker of the EE@@ A conve@@ ys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special interaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and conduc@@ ts appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts received from the accounts and the amounts paid from the account and the payments received from the account are visible to the Member States .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely to achieve the goals of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker through the full issuing of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time receive an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or plans financed by special action bodies , and on all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organization may agree on , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be invalid upon immediate effect .
if the entire amount of capital paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the Sec@@ retariat General of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of these procedures .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the Reg@@ ular Appro@@ val of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notice in the organization .
this agreement is written in two signatures in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter to change the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T issue :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics

and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
this program comprises the creation of a large experimental facility , the JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a joint venture pursuant to chapter V of Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Venture JET . &quot;
Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since extensive work is to be carried out until the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research , which have attained a higher priority due to the energy crisis .
this agreement shall enable any contracting party to benefit from a merger of its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the means provided for mutual research work , to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and accordingly achieve the common objective of this research , i.e. , the cost @-@ effective electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the aim of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme will take over the long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or amended according to the bodies named in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that there may be new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this will take place at the place of the program listed in Annex I and II to the present agreement .
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realized by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom program ;
- Mut@@ ual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .

with the same objective , Eur@@ atom contributes to the fact that Switzerland particip@@ ates in the agreement on the promotion of the human resource exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot;
in view of the participation in the JET project , Switzerland is a member of the joint venture JET , which accepts these articles at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement .
Eur@@ atom also ensures that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose goal falls within the scope of the present agreement except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the organs entrusted with the carrying out of the association provided in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the association agreement is particularly concerned with the suspension of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor and direct the development of research work to achieve the best possible results in line with the goals of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates representing the connection group in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - the following &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , is responsible for all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and alig@@ ns its T * activity in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common goal specified in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme and to the scientific and technological developments in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Procedure , the VG appoint one or several Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the responsible Swiss authorities are seeking .
the consulting groups , which provide the VG research proposals with regard to the fact that the means approved for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this task in terms of all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .
Switzerland is represented in the committee of directors used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program by the director of one of the participating laboratories .

in the form of a letter to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
furthermore , in order to simplify the procedure for the adaptation of tari@@ ff @-@ tari@@ ff desig@@ nations in the event of renewed amendments to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it appears further to include an article 12 to the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes and suggest you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing .
I honor me to confirm you the entrance of your current letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the preceding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial contribution
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states if the banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the agreement could be concluded until the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounts ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery of member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for their application the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without a total of five years passed .
in the event of the opening of the credits and the extension of the loan , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , the first conc@@ essions will not be made prior to exp@@ ir@@ ation of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the dra@@ fts would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods taking into account the funds of the Bank , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who use the BI@@ S at the respective time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to acquire the necessary funds on the market itself , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum , corresponding to the Li@@ bor rate increased by an appropriate margin .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I am referring to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the determination of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . during these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina ple@@ dges to ensure that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed in accordance with conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form become possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find a suitable solution .

as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are determined by the community for the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed in accordance with conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form become possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find a suitable solution .
in the event that the Community takes the protection clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year in question .
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to the imports of products recorded by this agreement to a high rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in Consul@@ tation with Uruguay will change the quantity specified under number 2 according to the extent of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined according to the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , whereby the tax rate stated under number 5 is taken into account .
the total amount mentioned under number 2 will be determined on the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance shown on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the way recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively in the volume of blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are elabor@@ ated at the time .
according to definition , an international standard supplement contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary , observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter yields the di@@ lution of the agent in the final mix within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the re@@ integration of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( See Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren will contain 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of comparing the international standard serum anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties must be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the date of exp@@ iry date on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the feasibility studies ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying about phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with dry re@@ agents ) will be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that re@@ agent with the added substance continues to satisfy the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ent or re@@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , regardless of whether in liquid form or after replacement , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ment or gel or visible particles .
the re@@ agents used for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally coloured as long as possible , at least until an International Convention has come into effect on a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination can be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to perform tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may possibly be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checking of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents are to be kept from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents contain no substances of human origin .
a black and white printed label can be attached to each individual container in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ release ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ release ,
each shipment shall be accompanied by a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the Annex to this Protocol .

the effectiveness of the serum may in no case be less than 64 International units per ml .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum can also cause an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time necessary if the same attempts are carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity .

anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of each specific@@ ity can belong to one of two species that are distinguished by the conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is reached .
with others , which are called &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as bo@@ vine al@@ bum@@ in or other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are s@@ wollen in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may change if international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more individuals im@@ muni@@ zed by an@@ tigen D of the r@@ h system .
