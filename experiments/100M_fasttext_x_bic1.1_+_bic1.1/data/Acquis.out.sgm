<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">(GRÜNDE - a) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent within two years following entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bonds in order to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the term "Special account" which consists of the funds which the Member States contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement; this account is referred to by the organization as a steward and used (in this property the organization is referred to as "caretaker"), and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and according to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The transaction account is separated and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The entries are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non-interest notes issued by the Member State, to pay at the request in the currency of the relevant State at the Order of the Organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the organization of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may be entitled to make payments before the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the caretaker accepts approximately proportional concessions to the cash or the school jars to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of granting this loan, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its additional capacity to loan to loan terms without disagreement; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this fee must be paid directly to the organization that it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The receipts from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services made or provided in a member state; ii) in developing countries, the members of the organization, and the according to what the caretaker has set at the time of loan guarantee may be beneficiaries of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from a special transaction loan take place on the special transaction account, and the amount refunded in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the caretaker to the Member State as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker is instructed by the EWG until all special transaction loans have been awarded for the audit by the directors in preparation and about the plans and programs approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the payment of the special transaction loan, the caretaker informs the EEA quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible, the manager conveys a detailed account of the transaction accounts with a statement from the external auditor of the organization to this account closure as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the caretaker of the EEA conveys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special interaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and conducts appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts received from the accounts and the amounts paid from the account and the payments received from the account are visible to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely to achieve the goals of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker through the full issuing of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time receive an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or plans financed by special action bodies, and on all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, which the EEC and the Organization may agree on, the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting therefrom shall be invalid upon immediate effect.</seg>
