it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ h thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal temper@@ ament .
abili@@ fy is used to treat medium to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral intake of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the enam@@ el tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy should be removed , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is thought to be &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent acts as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the brain &apos;s activity , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their re@@ emergence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been examined in three studies for up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol for twelve weeks , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ sed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined on the basis of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and absor@@ bs the solution .
in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than those who received a placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
it also prevented A@@ bili@@ fy for up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo for the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
furthermore , the Committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of in@@ efficacy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including oc@@ cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials that lasted for one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia encountered during the treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , consideration should be taken to reduce or break the dose .
when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
( 56 @-@ 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia based on com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with super@@ imposed side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabolism .
if one considers the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefit should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ um / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ um ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or if they are pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the insufficient data storage for the safety of man and due to the concerns in the animal reproductive studies , unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ouse , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was observed in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from lanz@@ ap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo for potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and whose incidence is also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of an over@@ dose since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma connection .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine levels and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ amen in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ Rate @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operated dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed significantly higher rel@@ ap@@ se rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % in placebo .
in an och@@ re @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % occurred in significantly fewer patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior effectiveness in week 3 and a retention effect comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol in week 12 .
also in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um@@ mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar revers@@ al , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ gen@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which cataly@@ zes N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for extensive Met@@ aboli@@ zation via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and about 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ sm over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients did not show any gender @-@ related effects .
a population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with varying h@@ ep@@ atic cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional clinical studies , toxic@@ ity , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times of mean Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dosage or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , were no more than 6 % of the concentrations observed in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of apes and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that lead to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mean Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can use the enam@@ el tablets as an alternative to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders have been reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted for one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia encountered during treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia based on com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine levels and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an och@@ re @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % occurred in significantly fewer patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study comparing pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dosage or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that lead to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mean Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control as@@ cul@@ ari@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the clinical status used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the drug related to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
research on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including oc@@ cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted for one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia encountered during treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ it , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored concerning a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia based on com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that after all@@ some administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was used as an in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial intra@@ muscular ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after all@@ some administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo for potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and whose incidence is also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements in det@@ achment / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) involving 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms in terms of as@@ cul@@ tation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Depression @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an och@@ re @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % occurred in significantly fewer patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um@@ mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar revers@@ al , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the dose of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were intra@@ muscular in 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
in studies for reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) were above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times of mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( up to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dosage or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that lead to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole application or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators like time to the wor@@ sen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatment of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood prior to treatment .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with the first treatment than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines , it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not indicated ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ages &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in sensory Neu@@ rop@@ athy Level 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an al@@ bum@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have substantially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no new abrasion treatments should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if , after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , nausea , vom@@ iting , and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and contra@@ sting methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women at child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women at child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm preservation , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible bar@@ r@@ enness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) that can affect the transport activity and the ability to operate machines .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 contains the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in trials ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tation hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain of g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , ul@@ c@@ ers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of the muscul@@ ature , neck pain , neck pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal muscul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ icro@@ bial agent that promotes the consolidation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ a and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ u@@ bular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that al@@ bum@@ in im@@ parts the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of al@@ bum@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( cream protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two cre@@ amy un@@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 , or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 than 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % for metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Level 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after a solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available for patients over 75 years of age , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light above 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , caution should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane breakthrough bottle .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material .
then the water bottle for at least 2 minutes should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and carefully and / or inver@@ ted until complete suspension of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itations or sm@@ el@@ ines are visible , the water bottle has to be inver@@ ted again gently in order to achieve a complete reset in front of the application .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market before market launch will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail outlets with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the features of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging . • Co@@ oling boxes for transport by patients with a clear picture of the correct application of the product .
this means that se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be controlled prior to treatment to make sure there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , capable of producing epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference drug as an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to either Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of se@@ amed se@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging , mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
se@@ amed must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that stores se@@ amed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the placing of se@@ amed in the European Union .
the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of the need for trans@@ fusion in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) exists .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned large operating procedures , which require large amounts of blood for women ; 5 or more blood vessels in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and tor@@ tures may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa @-@ dose should be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by at least 1 g / kg ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / kg three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , an an@@ alogy to the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ ae is required , should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins to provide large iron reserves before the start of the se@@ amed phase therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medication into the circulation .
patients suffering from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin at er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ eria ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in patients who are not eligible for a larger electro @-@ orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , es@@ cor@@ t or sc@@ and@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently joined cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ amp@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the common causes of failure ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ escence , infections or hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; index &quot; ) , is decreased ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended in section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed if er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ds @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and cor@@ on@@ ary cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency in maintenance therapy , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is not accelerated in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated .
for tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ fun@@ tioned ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y@@ an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take account of the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger , elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the start of epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may pers@@ ist .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in was targeted at 12 @-@ 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ cor@@ ed and is identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ alog@@ ous patients .
with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells it could be shown that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ n and the patient .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ en er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n showed a uni@@ denti@@ fied , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ en er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ en er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels , which are achieved after intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ mal fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
14 In animal experimental studies with nearly 20 times the recommended weekly dose for humans , epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa was reduced to a reduced federal body weight , a del@@ aying of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in the fet@@ al mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder has to provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • Education brochure • summary of the features of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts .
the license holder has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 is established and functioning in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug is applied in traffic .
the license holder comm@@ its to implement the studies and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , as outlined in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) described in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the Au@@ thor@@ isation Application , as well as in accordance with each subsequent risk management plan adopted in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. .
an updated R@@ MP should be available at the same time as the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Issu@@ es for human use .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information , which could affect the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction )
• In a month before your treatment have suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( first occurring or increased chest pain ) • the risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) exists - if , for example , such a drop of blood has occurred .
they suffer from severe circul@@ atory disturbances of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with se@@ amed amed it can come within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is re@@ formed during further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ integration of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be considered and treated before starting treatment with se@@ amed .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ eria after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kl@@ ed ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , se@@ amed must be given by injection in a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in would risk the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an interruption of treatment with se@@ amed up until the potassium levels are again in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs with inadequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and the desired effect should be taken into account for the assessment of the efficacy of se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed against the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cul@@ tur@@ es@@ occur in the past ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed acts as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain conditions can affect the tumor .
if a larger orthop@@ edic operation is im@@ min@@ ent , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before treatment begins .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get rid of se@@ amed as there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken the medicine , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests showed no interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed on two equally sized inj@@ ections .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia appeals to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to make sure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating doctor will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure yourself to se@@ amed yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , vascular extensions ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys have been reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment .
ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( qu@@ in@@ ck e@@ dem@@ a ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat , and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ amp@@ en@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can - regardless of the treatment with se@@ amed - come to a blood cl@@ ump ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
treatment with se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood pro@@ ps after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your initial stroke count is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly imp@@ air you or if you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
if a sy@@ ringe has been removed from the fridge and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used or dis@@ car@@ ded within 3 days .
it is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a lower trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the case of H@@ infections ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with disease Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ a can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
to treat the disease Pa@@ get may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active substance in Ac@@ la@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evaluating Ac@@ up@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 older women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was investigated .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a frac@@ ture score ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ a was tested in two studies of a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % in patients under Ac@@ la@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) over a period of three years compared to the patients .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ up@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ a are exposed to the risk of kidney problems , reactions at the in@@ fusion place and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ on@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ a provides clari@@ fication material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ tivi@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how to use the medicine , and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited approved for the placing of Ac@@ credi@@ a in the European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous 5 mg intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ bas@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ tivi@@ a , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of basic calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ up@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ up@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in elderly patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because data on safety and efficacy are missing .
for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , Ac@@ up@@ a is not recommended because limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with acet@@ a before the start of the therapy with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the fast implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of basic calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental interventions , no data is available , whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of acet@@ ab@@ a can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) were the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid has been associated with kidney function disorders , which act as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. increasing the serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and impaired ren@@ al function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis in three years comparable between the placebo and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ up@@ a compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred at 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ up@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with acet@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study for the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a l@@ itt@@ led hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions at the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial area has been treated , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which have been treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron foli@@ c acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions .
7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in one with Ac@@ la@@ a and patients treated with placebo .
in case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ up@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density value ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ - 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric retinal frac@@ tures were significant over a period of three years and the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see Table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ ylene frac@@ tures yiel@@ ded the same lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ a increased bone density along the lum@@ bar spine , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the hed@@ geho@@ g neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with Ac@@ la@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of oste@@ opor@@ otic disease , bone biop@@ sies were taken out of the pel@@ vic ridge .
in comparison to placebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients during periods of study .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ up@@ a reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the treatment in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased BM@@ D at all times compared to placebo treatment .
over 24 months , the treatment led to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % compared to placebo and 4.3 % at the threshold .
clinical efficacy in males In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in men treated with acet@@ one compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once yearly administration of acet@@ a in comparison with the once weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in the BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment with the disease Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ tivi@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically approved , mainly mild to moder@@ ately heavy disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2.6 to 3,@@ 0@@ x age specific upper normal value when taken into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
in the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ a and 107 patients taking part in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response could be maintained in 141 of patients treated with tears , compared to 71 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , with an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron foli@@ c acid in 64 patients revealed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ si@@ cally independent .
after that the plasma label quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the highest value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ a 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination round time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the t ½ -@@ values above ) probably represent fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced clearance of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction of up to 35 ml / min with no dose adjustment of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
because for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest dose of intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C were 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron foli@@ c acid in rats was administered by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 6@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
on rats one observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .

Ris@@ ko Management Plan The holder of approval for placing on the market under@@ takes to carry out studies and additional activities related to pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , which are presented in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the application for authorisation and all of the following versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could influence the current security , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . • On request of E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron A@@ ci@@ d is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
declining blood levels of sex hormones , above all est@@ rogen , which are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in males .
in the case of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , bone reconstruction takes place too quickly , and new bone material is constructed un@@ sorted , making the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ a works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and gives the bone its strength again .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ a .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken the medicine , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines which are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ up@@ a together with food and drink , make sure that you take sufficient fluids in accordance with the instructions of your doctor before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year administered by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of acet@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ tivi@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in your blood after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ tivi@@ a can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before ending treatment with Ac@@ la@@ a Falls you are considering ending treatment with Ac@@ la@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion do occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a .
at present it is unclear whether Ac@@ tivi@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ tivi@@ a .
physical signs because of a low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or de@@ af feeling , especially around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or non @-@ healing wounds in the mouth or on the jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ a patients have to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
because of the fast implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ tivi@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of basic calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a .
in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the pack supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ COMP@@ LIA is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which suffer from obesity ( disease obesity ) with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
in addition , four studies were conducted to more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting the smoking .
in contrast to the studies on the setting of smoking , no uniform results showed , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess in this area of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA ? it The most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LIA , which were observed during trials ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants since it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable at the same time using A@@ COMP@@ LIA with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( drugs against fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ COMP@@ LIA in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
it is used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing re@@ conn@@ aissance packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the Ar@@ z
it can be added to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ COMP@@ LIA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in the case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in individual cases predomin@@ ates the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
even in patients who - besides obesity - do not have noticeable risks , depres@@ sive reactions may occur .
relatives or other nearby persons ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ derly patients The effectiveness and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown adequately .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .
ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort , has not been examined , is believed that the simultaneous administration of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors inhi@@ bits the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant
we examined both overweight patients as well as in patients with an obesity , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and metabolic disorders .
it was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ates ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ desirable effects &lt; 1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very low
in a case study , where a limited number of people were given disposable records of up to 300 mg , only light symptoms were observed .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and simultaneously existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
n weight reduction after one year was 20 mg 6.5 kg for A@@ COMP@@ LIA , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,@@ 4 , -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ COMP@@ LIA and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference between the average weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
improvement of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z

5.3 Pre @-@ clinical data on the safety of the following un@@ desirable effects that were not observed in clinical studies but were n@@ g in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area were evaluated as potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some cases , however , not in all cases the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions appears to be associated with proced@@ ural stress as to dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disturbances .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR@@ A for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diab@@ etic medication ) is not indicated .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dosage .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ ure@@ a or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acet@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sulph@@ onic resin or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , which means that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ ure@@ a , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or Plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
acet@@ tos led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced in doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ure@@ a showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of acet@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thesis ( reduced suscep@@ ti@@ bility to irrit@@ ation ) .
acet@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that within the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) , Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients whose met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approved for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficiently adjusted with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age is not available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated output liver enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the Li@@ ver Enzy@@ mes are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper abdom@@ en problems , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one continues , should be led to the presence of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which may arise from fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ ence by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ ence by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ ure@@ a or as a two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin is the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a reduction in visual acuity was reported in the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , occurrence or deterioration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but promising physicians should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report disorders of visual acuity , a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3,5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment should be dismissed ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel block@@ ers , and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C from pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ cholester@@ ol@@ a@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal decreases and therefore the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth is reduced .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( in@@ valuable from available data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tower and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents performed more often than placebo over three times the upper limit of the normal range , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ure@@ a .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one respectively .
since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency has rarely been reported in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summari@@ zing analysis of messages of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups .
in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparable medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days appeared no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to be activated via activation of specific cell recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ lin@@ cide as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time up to the release of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy started , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diab@@ e@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as a marginal , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol level have been observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ lin@@ cide , and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one whereas lower levels of met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ lin@@ cide were observed .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ id@@ al elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised to either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the top concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in approximately three times the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clear@@ ances of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ology studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ cholester@@ ol@@ a@@ emia resulting in the gest@@ ation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the parent and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tumours .
the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry the inscription &quot; 30 &quot; on one side and the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3,5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication .
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were investigated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ lin@@ cide .
in clinical trials over 1 year , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ id@@ al elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this has an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target with respect to its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied with a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been reduced similarly to a different insulin in@@ insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the package contents ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by a intensified insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia alert symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change concerning starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin in animal origin ) can cause a change in dosing .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia are less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his physician , as such trips may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always for other drugs taken from them .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diab@@ e@@ tics should therefore always have grape picking , cand@@ y , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a designated assistant or given by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .

acet@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human@@ - ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ p@@ id may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin can be raised first , then the amount of insulin which is active .
3 In case of alternating with acet@@ one in the patient a dose adjustment is necessary , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his physician , as such trips may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and ail@@ ments at the place of administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diab@@ etic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that a 42 % mortality induced by intraven@@ ous acet@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the whole activity takes about 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

this can happen : • If you inj@@ ine too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you do more than yourself physically
always put the cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let manufacturing p@@ ens whenever it is not in use to protect it from light .
remove the sealing cap . • Please always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Remove the protective flap from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • Scre@@ w the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • Remove the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • kno@@ ck a couple of times with your finger slightly against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , they will accum@@ ulate in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues to move up , press the cartridge in the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle still shows upwards , press the pressure button in the right ( figure C ) • Now a drop of insulin must escape from the tip of the injection needle .
• Set the cap back on the finished pen so that the digit 0 stands in front of the metering mark ( figure D ) • Check if the press button is pressed completely down .
if the pressure button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the pus@@ h@@ button moves out@@ wards while you rotate the cap • The scale below the pus@@ h@@ button ( pus@@ h@@ button dial ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Note the highest number that you can see on the push button dial • Ad@@ just the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the thumb cap forward or backward until you have set the correct number of units .
turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you feel a resistance . then take the cap off and set it back in such a way that the 0 of the metering mark is opposite .
be sure to press the push button only while inj@@ ecting • Ke@@ ep the push button completely pressed after injection until the injection needle has been pulled out of the skin .
it is possibly in@@ accurate • You cannot set a dose which is higher than the number of remaining units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is still left , but you cannot use it to stop or select your dose .

aden@@ o@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or lymp@@ h nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , there are still some cases of rheum@@ atism ; this is why patients are recommended to take more medicines for preventing rheum@@ atism during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ o@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ o@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ auer ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ o@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who took 120 mg once a day in the last three measurements had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ o@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , in reducing the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood , aden@@ o@@ ic was more effective in blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also cause a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits ( including one from the medical history known or current g@@ out node and / or arthritis ) .
if the Ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into account daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully examined in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
because there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other drug @-@ like medicines , acute g@@ out attacks may occur during the course of treatment , because ure@@ tic acid deposits in the tissue can first be mobili@@ sed by lowering the serum .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases can increase so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the treatment and in the course of the course ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was not performed any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition leads to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( inhibit@@ ing the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ ar exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ azi@@ de / Var@@ dy@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study involving test subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily had a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de slow@@ s the absorption of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies cannot be associated with side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious at controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects associated with the medicine in the treatment groups and reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related to long @-@ term follow @-@ up studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses at all or with a lower frequency :

clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was demonstrated in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ specific serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

the lowering of the serum urine acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cholesterol in@@ suffici@@ ency &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage response of serum levels in patients , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum @-@ acid @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected during two years of the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum levels of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against a po@@ ison@@ ous feed in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against sp@@ illing ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in a complete dis@@ appearance of the lymp@@ h nodes up to 24 % in 54 % of the patients .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ s / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose increased propor@@ tionally .
for dos@@ ages between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline in serum &apos;s acid concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma connection of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bond to al@@ bum@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool found itself as un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at decreased about 1.8 times from 7.5 m / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered ir@@ relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
in case of high doses , which were about 4 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied by lowering the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ ower and a development delay in the descendants of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , with a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first eating of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than for those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data showing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) , and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , tum@@ bled abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic sho@@ cks .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can not be used .
it must not be used in es@@ oph@@ agus diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following tips are to be followed carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or de@@ compose the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ la@@ sty , are only given with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some of them were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate potential pal@@ sy reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end the medicine and seek medical advice in case of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ active pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be elevated in patients who do not use the medicine properly and / or continue taking it after symptoms caused by an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while there was no increased risk in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , some of them severe and with complications , were rarely reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens predominantly contain intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there is no data available to indicate whether to replace a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a jaw @-@ surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treating physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE they should take the tablet the next morning after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but keep taking one tablet a week as originally planned at the scheduled week@@ day .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials in common with a wide range of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw has been reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also oste@@ opor@@ osis symptoms have been reported .
nevertheless , deriv@@ atives of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ cholesterol into vitamin D3 .

the therapeutic equivalent of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6,@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the moderate asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day amounted to 8.@@ 8 % on the spine after 3 years , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ t .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to placebo ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of BM@@ D of verteb@@ ral column and tro@@ t continued to continue ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. a day either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7,@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15,@@ 0 % ) .
absorption Based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting and two hours before the intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased by about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in tissue tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but is then rapidly circul@@ ated into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion following intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the substance selected was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting .
after the intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .
absorption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) after the application of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting and two hours before the intake of a meal , the middle area below the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 is 29@@ 6.@@ 4 n@@ g • h / ml ( without taking into account an endo@@ genous vitamin D3 @-@ mirror ) .
the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and the medium time until reaching maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ ated in the liver to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney at 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion With the application of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D3 to healthy volunteers , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2,4 % , in the fa@@ ec@@ es after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine .
although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .

an@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted to a kidney or liver in order to prevent transplan@@ ted organ rejection by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ ft / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .

the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a year of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and investigated , as Adv@@ agra@@ f is taken up by the body in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the strict control of a medical device experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical supervision and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirrors should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a Tal@@ king level , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate postoperative period .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adaptation of the advance dose can take several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral ing@@ es@@ tion of drugs in the first postoperative period , the treatment of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be administered intraven@@ ously ( pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application For the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral an@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may later become necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral an@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f is a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to be converted to a once daily intake of an@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , in relation to the entire daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to an an@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral and liver transplan@@ ts must begin with the oral initiation dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to an an@@ agra@@ f , an initial initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients - although there is no clinical experience with an@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and col@@ on transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in case of transplan@@ ted patients in an initial initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood tal mirr@@ oring in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to decrease the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Because kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that dose adjustment is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ inity and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to Adv@@ agra@@ f With the conversion from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of full @-@ blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be checked after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to an an@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus complete blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley level of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and cardiac and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the strict control of a medical device experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be treated as therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart gra@@ fts and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal medicines during a treatment with Adv@@ oc@@ am@@ um ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood @-@ mirrors may be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy designated as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under an@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons by appropriate clothing or use of a sun@@ screen with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and blur@@ red vision should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as an an@@ agra@@ f of hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contained , special caution is given in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction was achieved with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , it is especially cau@@ tious when taking decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal tests have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyper@@ alkal@@ ine ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following are the side effects following their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

cases of virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ able .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell inner , are likely to be medi@@ ated at the molecular level .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ sensitive inhi@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymph@@ oma genes .

overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ t recipients .
in an interim analysis of a recently conducted multic@@ enter study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans was observed in 2@@ 1,7 % compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi @-@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t following a random@@ ised Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml of the 5 .
the published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ tations showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after transplantation .
this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the elimination occurs mainly via the bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients ( twice a day ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be treated as therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advoc@@ ates are used to treat ble@@ ed@@ ings or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A patients suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was inserted , which it em@@ powers to form the human scent factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding into 86 % of 510 new blood counts with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; gut &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ates may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to Ba@@ x@@ ter AG to the establishment of lawyers in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depends on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , a proper determination of factor VI@@ II plasma level is recommended to control the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
in their response , individual patients may differ by factor VI@@ II , perform various in vivo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within the interval of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the dose rate should be based on the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A patients .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , with the risk of being greatest in the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expos@@ ures and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients showing a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of each patient ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance @-@ Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th post@@ oper@@ atively .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE .
in addition , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was observed in none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE was treated with inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pre@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions as part of the study .
7 . as with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ des responses ( frequency not known ) .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
for this reason , the CH@@ MP is based on the A@@ DV@@ ATE &apos;s safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , it is decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further extension in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) officially shared the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company accepts its application for the placing of Adv@@ ex@@ in on the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , allowing cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene present in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer occurred in the area of the abdom@@ en , bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP will prepare a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has advantages for the patients .
the Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ im can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programmes with lawyers .
&quot; changing active ingredients &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a couple of hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by allergy to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are dis@@ kl@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reli@@ ed on con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of ha@@ y fever symptoms which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all ha@@ y fever symptoms in addition to con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ re@@ adi@@ ene ( another drug for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from con@@ genital glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( over@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) , or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking it or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after symptoms of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine decreases with time for long @-@ term use .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors resp@@ . within the 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , li@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data does not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data does not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or head@@ aches ) must be removed .
patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with either des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not that was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibited and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies showed no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in impair@@ ment of the air@@ worth@@ iness or the ability to operate machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible tablets .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ valent pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is especially likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both trials , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine during the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nose @-@ mu@@ cous swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the plasma was administered .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the fluid balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine according to the sole application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
however , based on conventional clinical studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not allow any particular danger to humans .
the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and g@@ lowing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .

tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed with you under the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • heart hunting , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches or strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
when taking aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
traffic ti@@ ghtness and the operation of machines When using the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to drow@@ sin@@ ess or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you have forgotten to take a dose in time , pick up the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ pation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulty , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes have been reported .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia with increased physical activity , cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver flu@@ kes was also very rarely reported .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies of about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by investigating the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squ@@ ads , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utilizes the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and utilize the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is un@@ think@@ able .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the scores ( scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in both trials in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the reduction of the scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ re@@ adi@@ ene or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for placing an agreement on the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have ended and can be resum@@ ed .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the period of allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in impair@@ ment of traffic resistance or ability to operate machines .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adolescents from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ phase clinical dosage ) .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses where des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dosage ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , nas@@ al flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall core of the questionnaire regarding the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited .
as hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that , besides chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected to improve the symptoms even in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the rate of the disease by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patient demo@@ s were comparable with the overall seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ul@@ us after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in vivo does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ re@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ re@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional clinical studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular danger for humans .

A@@ erial can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metaboli@@ se and experience a higher distance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 is identical to that of children that metaboli@@ se normal .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems should not use fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption sh@@ em@@ ming , or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , reported at the recommended dose , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times the clinical dosage ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who were eligible for anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dosage ) was applied for over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies showed no impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ otor functions .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the intake of alcohol was neither increased nor increased drow@@ sin@@ ess due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , nas@@ al flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall core of the questionnaire regarding the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are limiting .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) caused by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the AU@@ C and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those recommended by adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown plastic bottles with a child @-@ safe polypropylene closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ats must be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ phase clinical dosage ) .
in two single dose trials , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was tolerated well ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses where des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dosage ) was applied for over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , nas@@ al flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

there is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of the side @-@ effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was the same and did not significantly reduce the safety profile detected in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s enam@@ el tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet form@@ ulations and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the decreasing formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the total frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most commonly encountered side @-@ effects were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .

after the market launch of A@@ eri@@ us , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) and skin rash were reported .
A@@ erial solution for admission is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 years , teenagers ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution is applied to take an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling , you can use it alternatively to take the appropriate amount of solution to take .
regarding treatment duration , your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you suffer and will determine how long you should take A@@ erial solution to take .
however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rhe@@ a , fever and in@@ som@@ nia frequent side effects were reported in adults ti@@ redness , dry mouth and head@@ aches more often than with placebo .
97 A@@ erial solution for insertion is available in bottles with child safe closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml pack@@ et size is a measuring spoon or application sy@@ ringe F@@ û@@ r Prepar@@ ations for use with sc@@ aling of 2.5 m@@ l@@ - and 5 ml cans .
in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced to the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company accepts its application for the placing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of the avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic occurs when a new strain of the flu virus is emerging , which can easily be spread by humans , because humans have not built up immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the influ@@ enza virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to make antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this trunk .
subsequently , the membrane covering of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognis@@ es as foreign ) was puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like further information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has tested which an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood when used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
aids not cure can , however , delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
A@@ gener@@ ase , which was enhanced with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or changing the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors responded very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drugs used with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r decreased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gen@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger decline in the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who took their prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors further :
the most common side effects of A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ ic@@ ol@@ ite or any of the other components .
generic A@@ bo@@ g@@ wort can also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( an herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded in the same way as at@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations .
as with other medicines for HIV , the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children were out@@ weigh@@ ed over four years compared to the risks .
as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under exceptional circumstances , as only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited approved for the placing of A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase in the European Union .
A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
usually , am@@ ni@@ otic capsules should be given to the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Boo@@ ster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of AM@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is 14 % lower than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , a@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the increased addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ y ) , higher doses of A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) have to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of ammonia which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
con@@ current application should be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
generic A@@ bo@@ ch@@ rom may not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ me 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used as a result of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with previously reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including the Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
because the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ather@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who take these drugs at the same time , A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with det@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with AM@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase should be removed for a duration of 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases that could be used to treat medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors associated with prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeu@@ tical width cannot be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ me 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeu@@ tical width A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given along with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly metaboli@@ sed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a development of resistance .
in the attempt to balance the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of AM@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already uses St. John &apos;s wort , the pren@@ atal mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increased , by 30 % lower for C@@ max when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment schem@@ as .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but it is recommended that Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s revenues are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z combined with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and available limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ ic@@ ol@@ ite .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with a@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is advised , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including medi@@ ums , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may result in interactions with a@@ generic kin@@ ase , possibly causing interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with a@@ generic term .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase as it may result in res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants , known as enzyme reduc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of ammonia .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
simultaneous intake with A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of as@@ er@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected to increase the level of plasma levels while administration of a@@ generic gases .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may result in my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicinal product is not recommended by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while offering Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase cannot be used together with oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while caution is required while using A@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ barrel .
if Meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation of how to adapt the dose of the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with at@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( such as des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of a@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into the breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the intervention in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive ability , was not affected by the administration of the mold on the parent animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether or not they are associated with the use of A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg a@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of recurring laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ ec@@ al fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation ( bull jackets ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally not pre @-@ treated persons treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( p@@ ens ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients suffering from in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular @-@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching , and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of as@@ re@@ ase each day together with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) to those who were observed under any at@@ ase treatment ; an exception formed increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which occurred in patients who received a@@ gen@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to be observed on signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ cation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically investigated .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic isolation of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 extension ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analysis systems can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance to the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes due to additional data and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clinical vali@@ dated ph@@ er@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r produces a certain cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r , and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally not pre @-@ treated patients , in which a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 Isol@@ ates ) appear .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which PI pre@@ treated adults received after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ clear osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ sub@@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ cut@@ aneous threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of in@@ born at@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase &apos;s solution for taking and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks about 25 % of patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; a@@ generic term should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI .
after oral administration the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increased , reduced for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active agent in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ connected ammonia which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines which in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time with A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ ger@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily as@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore , a@@ gener@@ ase solution and ag@@ generic capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ basis .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ u@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily offering of 1200 mg of am@@ ate@@ ar .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical studies , no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals that were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with det@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus el@@ on@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the increased addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ y ) , higher doses of a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) have to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of ammonia which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
con@@ current application should be performed with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase should be removed for a duration of 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a development of resistance .
5@@ 08 % increased , by 30 % lower for C@@ max when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z combined with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with a@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although there are no clinical data available .

with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with at@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the intervention in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to be observed on signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ cation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .

the benefit of patients treated with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; ro@@ oi@@ bos &apos; was neither used in patients with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is 14 % lower than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , a@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase can be given to intake and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although dose adjustment is not deemed necessary for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gen@@ ase is a solution for taking small children and children under the age of 4 , with pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially provoke serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent 47 from transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
methods for determining the drug concentration are available for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) .

simultaneous intake with A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and lead with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected following oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , A@@ gen@@ ase &apos;s solution may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into the breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the intervention in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start taking A@@ bo@@ th@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in some patients who receive anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue due to insufficient blood supply ) can develop .
if you are taking Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after at@@ ase , otherwise the effects of a@@ generic ase can be dimin@@ ished .
94 To make use of A@@ gen@@ ase as big as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you .

dose of A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in order for A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase to benefit as much as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you .
if you have taken larger amounts of a@@ gener@@ ase than you should , if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of a@@ gener@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately .
the benefit of patients treated with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; ro@@ oi@@ bos &apos; was neither used in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors or with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors of pre @-@ treated patients .
for applying low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( usually applied to gain the effect &#91; boo@@ y &#93; of ag@@ generic capsules ) along with A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase solution to intake , no dosage recommendations can be given .
take k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r solution for intake ) , or additionally take prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col while taking A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase solution ( see also A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase must not be taken ) .
your doctor will probably monitor you on side effects associated with the propylene gly@@ col content of the a@@ generic solution for taking into account , especially if you have kidney or liver disease .
111 If you are using certain medicines which may cause serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ bo@@ at@@ ase , your doctor will perhaps perform additional blood tests to minimize possible security problems .
do not take k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r solution ( intake ) or additional prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col , while taking A@@ bo@@ gener@@ ase ( see A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase must not be taken ) .
important information on certain other components of A@@ gen@@ ase solution to take @-@ in contains Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col , which may cause side effects in high doses .
Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col can cause a number of side effects including var@@ ic@@ ose , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , heart rate and the reduction of red blood cells ( see also A@@ bo@@ g@@ ase may not be taken , special caution when taking a@@ generic ase is necessary precau@@ tions ) .

this can include fat loss on legs , arms and face , fat gain in the abdom@@ en and other inner organs , breast enlargement and fat bul@@ ging in the neck ( &quot; stit@@ ching &quot; ) .
the other ingredients are propylene gly@@ col , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( polyethylene gly@@ col 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial ch@@ ewing gum flavor , lev@@ om@@ en@@ tho@@ l , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate , puri@@ fied water .
the frequency of application and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is repeated five times a week for six weeks . • Dur@@ ing one or two four @-@ week treatment courses , it is performed three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin layer to apply to the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo administered either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ os .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total radiation rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in the patients treated with placebo had a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non hyper@@ trop@@ ic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic acute ker@@ at@@ ose ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
open Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream is to continue until all visible stain@@ s have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
a break in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the treated l@@ esi@@ ons were only completely healed after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient may apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and continue with the usual therapeutic plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in a thin layer and puri@@ fy it in the puri@@ fied areas of the skin until the cream is completely absorbed .
it should be weigh@@ ed in these patients between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should be weigh@@ ed in these patients between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies in which no daily pre @-@ famili@@ arization was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with circumcision leading to circumcision were observed .
an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed in rare cases , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly after treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ected means for the treatment of external inclin@@ ation war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal area no clinical experiences are present .
limited data suggests a higher rate of suscep@@ ti@@ bility to HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of the fung@@ al war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be done several days .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in case of super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there is no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tumours .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ose on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id .
only very limited data are available about the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ose in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands do not support the efficacy in this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 active l@@ esi@@ ons showed less complete healing rates than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although the serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been quanti@@ fiable neither after one @-@ off nor after repeated use of the top@@ ical application , no recommendation can be given for use during breast@@ feeding .
local reactions to the treatment of the fung@@ al war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) were the most common adverse events associated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the studies of three times weekly treatment .
the most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects include discomfort at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream related adverse effect , were in these studies a reaction at the application place ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects indicated by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs , provided according to the test plan , shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream , it often came to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ting / leaving / dropping ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical evidence provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) and heavy scor@@ ing and ru@@ sting ( 19 % ) occurred .
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) was observed at the treatment site or in the surrounding area .
the accidental , unique oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , corresponding to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the most clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous de@@ hydr@@ ation .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical study , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the fung@@ al war@@ ts in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is significantly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
in 60 % of patients who were treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the disease was completely cured ; this was the case at 20 % of the patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 male patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od versus 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy of five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically ex@@ iled and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic action l@@ esi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing following one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external cow@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not normally occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three week use during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml at the application in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low according to top@@ ical application on MC @-@ sick skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity of rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study for the der@@ mal application carried out for four months also yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with der@@ mal administration on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ors at the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for the human being to view as very low due to the systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream before and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● Fin@@ ishing war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low lik@@ el@@ ihood of spread to other parts of the body .
if left untreated , it may lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints which complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with res@@ us@@ c@@ is@@ ers , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) include head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever , and reactions at the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years are higher blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review every year all new information that may be known , review and , where necessary , update this summary .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is a manufacturer of patients who receive al@@ um@@ ac@@ y@@ me with respect to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. an approval for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be performed in an appropriate clinical environment where recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies are expected to form antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption , the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of treatment must be cau@@ tious .
treat 60 minutes before starting in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ agents ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in the case of a single serious in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the previous response occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical studies were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older , are performed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted Medic@@ ations related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment , whereby the patient at the age of 5 with a heavier dri@@ ve@@ form usually came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or minor neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ al activity in vitro that did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzyme activity .
following intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of the patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement in lung function and ability to be cured in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients being taken into account by using a combined end point ( expected percentage of normal Fe@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted to study the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients , which were 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with a severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in urine in week 22 .
in several patients a growth of magnitude ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was observed after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas the older patients with a severe follow @-@ up form had limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional toxic@@ ity studies , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ off administration , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger for humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except those listed below 6.@@ 6 .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution was under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

within the given time , the owner of the marketing authorization has concluded the following program of study , the results of which form the basis for the annual assessment report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , is either present in small quantities or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic to any of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction has occurred on Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
a reaction @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken medicines , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
instructions for use - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , gradually increases to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - implic@@ ated involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
very common ( occurrence in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nausea • abdominal pain • skin rash • Joint pains , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the packaging contributions will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution was under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • First measure the number of water @-@ th@@ inning perfor@@ ations after body weight of each patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies , as sole therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood flow changes or if certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , reduced or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time of 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta , longer survival rates than with the comparison drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted permission to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each feed bottle needs to be dissolved with a 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose @-@ sis is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for predominantly plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma apart from over@@ sized plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids must be given on the day before and on the day of the p@@ emet@@ ric dose as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ emet@@ ry dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a plat@@ el@@ et count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times higher than the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dose test must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood balance or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predic@@ tive therapeutic cycles .
after recovery patients have to be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are to be applied for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient loses its value prior to treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dos@@ ages a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues in the appearance of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over , compared to patients aged 65 years , there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row technology and p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again have reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ - cy@@ te number once again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , plat@@ el@@ et count and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment courses ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was considered when pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ emet@@ ry must be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for whom treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is planned must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the out@@ flow before the p@@ emet@@ ric treatment is considered .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical studies with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible deterioration of reproductive capacity by p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men ought to be advised prior to the treatment of G@@ inn to obtain advice regarding sperm preservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) may result in reduced p@@ emet@@ ry elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution is advised if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed are avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ ry .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the cl@@ ot@@ ting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy calls for an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there is no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ ry mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - re an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during an application in pregnancy .
p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy , unless absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised prior to the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is transferred to breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed @-@ held as well as 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which was reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ised p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , included sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant degree of laboratory toxic@@ ity Grade 3 and 4 was similar to the phase 2 p@@ emet@@ ric treatment trials ( n = 164 ) of phase 2 , similar to the phase 3 p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed mono@@ therap@@ i@@ tis , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population , as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 trials included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects that may be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

there were reported cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated before , during or after their p@@ emet@@ ry treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important and acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti@@ fl@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ as@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ logical reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are followed by the following key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ enter , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful advantage of survival compared to those patients who were only treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in relation to the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ eli@@ oma was demonstrated in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC was treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , matched HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ ry mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ sub@@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination opposite the gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 3@@ 0,@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ submission margin of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) and plat@@ el@@ et trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients needed the administration of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ eti@@ n ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3,@@ 1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed as a mono@@ therapeu@@ tical therapy were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ ones over a period of 10 minutes .
p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is mainly left unchanged in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in the urine within 24 hours following the application .
p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed has a total junction of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs , who had received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , retinal changes were observed ( de@@ fam@@ ation / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ er epitheli@@ al tissue ) .

dissolve the contents of 100 mg water bottles with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preservatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed .
the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow without compromising the product quality .
each feed bottle needs to be dissolved with a 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
23 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical studies with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 100 mg powder for the production of a concentr@@ ates for the production of in@@ fusion solder A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg powder for the production of a concentr@@ ates for the production of in@@ fusion soldering
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who have not received previous chemotherapy for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ eli@@ oma ( vi@@ cious disease of the ri@@ b skin ) in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of cancer .
if you have a kidney or earlier one , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital ap@@ oth@@ ec@@ ologist , as you may not be allowed to receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
in the case of you , blood tests will be performed before each in@@ fusion ; it checks if your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have sufficient blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may possibly change the dose or stop treatment if it requires your general condition and if your blood levels are too low .
if you also get c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to avoid vom@@ iting before and after c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
if there is a fluid accumulation around the lungs , your doctor may decide to eliminate this fluid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
if you want a child during the treatment or during the first six months after the treatment , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
interactions with other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) such as drugs called &quot; non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka &quot; ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) , including medicines that are non @-@ prescription ( such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) .
depending on the planned da@@ - tion of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your kidney function , your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can take and when .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it does not contain prescription drugs .
a hospital ap@@ oth@@ ec@@ ologist , nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with a sterile 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you .
your doctor will prescri@@ be Kor@@ ti@@ son tablets ( according to 4 mg dex@@ am@@ eth@@ a two times a day ) , which you have to take on the day , during and the day after the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
your doctor will prescri@@ be foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) for taking or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain foli@@ c acid ( 350 to 1000 mc@@ g ) , which you must take during the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA once a day .
in the week before the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and approximately every 9 weeks ( corresponding to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) you will also receive an injection of vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the products .
for obes@@ e adults , a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter is used in conjunction with low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive any weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , causing approximately a quarter of the fats associated with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after a year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for the patients .
the most common side @-@ effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair finish , stu@@ n @-@ strand , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , passage of o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be used in patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or in ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited approved for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with an easily hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i , because the dose of anti@@ diab@@ etic should be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregn@@ an@@ cies to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma label was observed .
when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take supplements of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the application of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decline of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed for a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , since absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects observed after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of an unknown size .
† Es is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may cause anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were given for normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
most of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing were either reported to have either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the lip@@ id properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is applied in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ isch and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ a .
clinical studies have shown that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 determine the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies weight loss was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first six months .
the average figure in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin amounted to 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo -@@ 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average LD@@ L Cholester@@ ins changed with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg @-@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo -@@ 3.8 % ( initial value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the mean change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , not metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be found spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) without signs of accumulation .
two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ shaped leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , which represented nearly 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional clinical studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger for humans .
Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance System The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in the version of July 2007 , as described in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the start of treatment , as you might not have reduced the fat percentage in the diet at this time .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Begin a few days or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit is reduced . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take it in the form of a low @-@ fat main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with these accompanying symptoms learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of reach of children . • Do not use it for children after the exp@@ iry date given on the box . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects of this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was examined in 1 8@@ 42 adult patients who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : in order to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in case of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in cases of chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on as@@ say , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with the simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi shall neither be used to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population it was shown that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ i@@ ti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , so pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
clinical trials were the most common adverse events observed at a dose of 250 mc@@ g ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that could at least be associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and pal@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reaction at the place of meeting ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for an over@@ dose of al@@ op@@ ia .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life : 7.@@ 3 hours ) received , which was given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the study with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G @-@ parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
after intraven@@ ous administration a gradual decrease of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ of kg / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following the intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentrations was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days the overall composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ time dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated via the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies on the metabolism , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as imm@@ utable active substance made approximately 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous stu@@ b injection in healthy eyes , the overall length of the body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequately above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , clu@@ es showed that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose accounted for about 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is considered low for humans .
the European Commission must inform the European Commission on the plans for the placing of the drug approved within the framework of this decision .

June 2006 , the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the promise of approval for the placing of the treatment intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal component that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in micro@@ scopic examination , liver tissue damage causes damage , and the values of the Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are also increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) that stimulates it to form the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was treated ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged
furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was reduced to more patients than with the reference drug ; Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) are not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ s ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not affect this type of infection .
al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the area to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was dis@@ kl@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients in placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin cells , al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were examined by skin @-@ dogs , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order place .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for placing an advertisement in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is begun .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected place after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the impact of the simultaneous use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin area has not been examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after top@@ ical use on abra@@ ded skin or infected surface wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo cannot be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 The average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % after a simultaneous oral application of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole .
due to the low systemic exposure after top@@ ical use in patients , dose adjustment is not required if top@@ ical retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral ing@@ es@@ tion and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
during pregnancy , Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of systemic antibiotics .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the treatment with al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which were applied to al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the place of meeting that entered about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ angers ( formerly P@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ angers ) .
the mechanism of action of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site in the 50s sub@@ unit of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pep@@ tide transfer center .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance affect the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
in 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was carried out on the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and with the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ ve to 200 c@@ m2 shiel@@ ded skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism In vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with less involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in vitro screening of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in vivo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 of seclu@@ ded skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development toxic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were observed .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , with a protection against hepatitis B only after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if during the immun@@ isation there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is assured that the vacc@@ ination plan that can be made out of two cans is to be completed .
if a refres@@ her dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ ines authorized since 1996 , and the V@@ acc@@ ine used since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered within the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 months gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix used between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to six and a 12 months distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a hom@@ olog@@ ation for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for primary dimm@@ ing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two V@@ acc@@ ine doses , whereby the first dose at the date of the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster shot is desired for both Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated or vacc@@ inated using a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully assured that immun@@ o@@ competent people who responded to Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination need a booster shot as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in the case of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibody @-@ value is achieved after the basic dimm@@ ing , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these injection routes should be avoided .
in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , since in these cases it can come to bleeding after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ isation , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that no adequate immune response is possible .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ isation and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulated .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 V@@ acc@@ ine doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ality on a calculation base per acc@@ ination of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the volunteers who had received Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination regi@@ men .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of de@@ formed hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more common occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
statisti@@ cally , the percentage of vacc@@ ines reported about severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine as with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of de@@ formed hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials that were performed in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month of 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month of 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ rix after the 3 dose vaccine .
the immune responses reported in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
both trials received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of de@@ formed hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of mal@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was given at the same time with the booster shots of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ isation , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ines ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ R@@ imm@@ ed vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and serum conversion rates for the current formulation as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ sion@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
pursuant to article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge of the state is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as by bathing in waters contaminated by water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ inations ( although you / your child may not feel ill or ill at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those in hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If an allergic reaction has occurred to you or your child for an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly protect against Hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per acc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give your child a vacc@@ ination protection before finishing the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected into persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ ences / or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take more drugs / receive ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated recently / or has been given or has been planned in the near future .
however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 di@@ pped doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort at the insertion point or redness • mat@@ ur@@ ability • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 drop per 10 di@@ pped doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects that have been reported for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 impregn@@ ated doses ) are :
these include del@@ ici@@ ously limited or extended ras@@ hes , which can be it@@ chy or ves@@ ic@@ ular , swelling of the eye area and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop in blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 . consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will affect your child considerably or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which has become known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP advoc@@ ated that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ur@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ te is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach of the leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of the leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study since am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared to another treatment or with placebo ( a pseu@@ do drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
Am@@ mon@@ ella can also cause loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste experience , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ium in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels .
Am@@ mon@@ ze was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because only limited information about this drug was available due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval .
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ ected form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life month ) , there is then an indication of the use in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis a hyper@@ trop@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disturbances , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually by taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disturbances because there is a risk for the emergence of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a formation .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kidneys occurs , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in slow@@ ing neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of working nerve end@@ ings in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk in humans and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these un@@ desirable events it was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an abnormal toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with a single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose limiting ne@@ uro @-@ toxic@@ ity with intraven@@ ous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be thought to be produced for each gram of recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen elimination ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ um ( but within the first months of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during the course of the pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ ected form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ path@@ ian deficiency ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ metrop@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys via glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were calculated according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined 15 minutes after intake .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ kl@@ us or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 - 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher in plasma levels compared to first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results obtained by the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated rats did not have exc@@ ised effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who do not yet swal@@ low pills , or patients with swal@@ lowing disturbances ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ as or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat fl@@ utes were suspended before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , l@@ esi@@ ons occurred in the pyramid cells of the cor@@ tex .
an abnormal toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess fat
on the basis of investigations on ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients suffering from disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ al@@ but@@ yl is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ulate form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined 15 minutes after intake .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product un@@ parall@@ eled for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ yl is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot escape the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl is able to influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during breast@@ feeding you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since the medicine could pass into the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , ob@@ struction of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating a suitable treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed on same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ m@@ ite ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ulate . • Place a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the top edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of spo@@ ons gran@@ ules from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stem up@@ lift &quot; ( abnormal measured value with electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox in the sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
while PCI was often used to prevent the patient ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , with the exception of severe bleeding , where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the placing of angi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) with an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended starting dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous release of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI is performed in the patient , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours can be resum@@ ed according to clinical requirements .
a bol@@ us release of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the incidence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to application and the dose can be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt is checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included , the ACT score was 5 minutes after the administration of the bi@@ vali@@ ant @-@ bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and patients with di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox@@ y can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tioned he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular weight he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active agent or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or increased risk of bleeding due to abnormal hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible mental endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though most of the hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages of arter@@ ial punc@@ tu@@ ation occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment in principle bleeding .
in patients with War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after de@@ composition of the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ din again reaches the level prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ aggregate ) it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ din with plat@@ el@@ et unit numbers or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in any case are regularly checked .
the animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ or alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ date plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over the age of 65 were more likely to suffer adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common among bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ors than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY bleeding was defined as one of the following occur@@ ren@@ ces : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the punc@@ ture area , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ rh@@ al@@ is@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bi@@ vali@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ din group as well as in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over the age of 65 were more likely to suffer adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with a bi@@ vali@@ din is immediately abor@@ ted and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains a bi@@ vali@@ din , a direct and specific plat@@ inum inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as in the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at barley .
the binding of bi@@ vali@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible because th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in s@@ ways spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ din was able to in@@ duce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ din shows a dose and concentration dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , documented by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the patients , an additional bol@@ us of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before starting the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or with PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and 1 @-@ year end@@ point for the total population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients receiving aspir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before PCI ) are shown in tables 7 and 8 .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients exposed to a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ din were evaluated in patients who underwent a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ din as pep@@ tide has a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid components with subsequent re @-@ evaluation of amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolic rate resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ oses is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ oses .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over the age of six with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin lu@@ c@@ ine is very slightly different from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short acting insulin in@@ insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in the case of type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes decreased by 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin li@@ fes@@ sions .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration decreased by 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ c@@ ine or any of the other components or patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adapted if administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH an approval for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or administered sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with impair@@ ment of liver function .
any changes in the active force , the brand ( her@@ e- ) , the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ ar@@ ded , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change the need for insulin .
3 A inadequate dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment schem@@ as change .
substances which can increase blood glucose activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia belong to oral anti@@ diab@@ etic agents , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter regulation can be de@@ ported or absent from the effects of li@@ mp@@ ic drugs such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pine .
animal experiments on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin @-@ lu@@ c@@ ine passes into human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not enter into the breast milk , nor is it absorbed after oral application .
in the following are the un@@ desirable pharmaceutical ingredients known from clinical studies , group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes and ordered after decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency on the basis of available data ) .
cold @-@ sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual vom@@ iting or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog , changes of vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is fo@@ amed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , can occur in the sequence a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by an appropriately trained person , or by an intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ c@@ agon injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin the action occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in the normal insulin analog .
in a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ related dosing ranges from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional glucose @-@ lowering effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ome effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ c@@ ine has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was clear that during an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post @-@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin @-@ lu@@ c@@ ine was reduced 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin @-@ lu@@ c@@ ine is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as with human insulin , which is given 2 m@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see figure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ c@@ ine in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ c@@ ine in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor@@ mal acting insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
