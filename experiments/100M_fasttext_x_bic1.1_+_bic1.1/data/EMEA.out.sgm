<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the pack supplement (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like further information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirh thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disturbance, a mental illness, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal temperament.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat medium to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances when oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the enamel tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be removed, the dosage of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is thought to be "partial Agonist" for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent acts as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the brain's activity, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their reemergence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been examined in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol for twelve weeks, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined on the basis of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and absorbs the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness than those who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">It also prevented Abilify for up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (dizziness), drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of inefficacy with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including occelery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesien: in clinical trials that lasted for one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia encountered during the treatment with Ariadprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, consideration should be taken to reduce or break the dose.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Ariadprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">(56-99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with etoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphaggia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar mania based on comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with superimposed side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefit should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextrometum / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextrometum).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or if they are pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the insufficient data storage for the safety of man and due to the concerns in the animal reproductive studies, unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathouse, Dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with semi-operidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was observed in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients suffering from lanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups in Aripiprazole and placebo for potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy and whose incidence is also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Ariadprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of an overdose since Aripiprazole has a high plasma connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance is mediated on the combination of a partially agonistic effect on dopamine levels and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and to the serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a-receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on nucleus caudatus and the putamen in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operidol-controlled study, 52 the proportion of responder patients who had a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Ariadprazol 77% and semi-operidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery-DepressionsRate-Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperated dol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed significantly higher relapse rate of 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an ochre-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, a weight gain of at least 7% occurred in significantly fewer patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior effectiveness in week 3 and a retention effect comparable to that of lithium or semi-operidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week 12 Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serummirrors, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of bipolar reversal, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxygenation of Aripiprazole, which catalyzes N-dealkylamation by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ariadprazole for extensive Metabolization via CYP2D6 and about 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Ariadprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients did not show any gender-related effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Ariadprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with varying hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function to the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Ariadprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional clinical studies, toxicity, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data showed no particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times of mean Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dosage or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole, found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, were no more than 6% of the concentrations observed in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of apes and lie far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that lead to expositions of the 3- and 11x of the mean Steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once it is clinically attached, treatment with Aripiprazole injection solution should be terminated and commenced with oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">To increase the resorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended in circumvention of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the clinical status used for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the features of the drug related to Abilify tablets, Abilify enamel tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Ariadprazole Injection solution in patients with aggitightness and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Research on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole Injection Solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including occelery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted for one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia encountered during treatment with Ariadprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipit, polyurie, polyphaggia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored concerning a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar mania based on comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that after allsome administration of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy subjects Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was used as an intracranial intramuscular (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular, the intensity of the Sedation was greater compared to that after allsome administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical studies with Ariadprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: commonly (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups in Aripiprazole and placebo for potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy and whose incidence is also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole Injection Solution with statistically significant improvements in detachment / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to Halidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggitizing and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole Injection Solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in terms of ascultation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Ariadprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggitightness, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a half-operidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients who had a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and semi-operidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression-Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher decline in the return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an ochre-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, a weight gain of at least 7% occurred in significantly fewer patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serummirrors, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study expansion in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of bipolar reversal, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazole AUC is 90% larger than the dose of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazole Injection Solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which were intramuscular in 15- and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies for reproductive toxicity following intravenous application, no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) were above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies of Aripiprazole (oral) for security harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data showed no particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore, they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times of mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (up to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dosage or 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters earlier had received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in the sole application or as a monotherapy) was compared to a drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared with 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators like time to the worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatment of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) stated that Abraxane was more effective in patients with the first treatment than conventional paclitaxel and that unlike other paclitaxel medicines, it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the marketing of Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed the first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing treatment is not indicated (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophages &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory Neuropathy Level 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to degree 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosages in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies were conducted with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosages in patients with impairment of the kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel, which could have substantially different pharmacological characteristics as other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no new abrasion treatments should be initiated until the neutrophils increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the platelet number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">Whereas the cardiotoxicity associated with Abraxane has not been proven, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If, after the administration of Abraxane, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea occur, these can be treated with the usual anti-emetic and contrasting methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women at childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women at childbearing age should use a reliable method of contraception during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm preservation, as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible barrenness.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (frequently) that can affect the transport activity and the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most remarkable hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported at 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 contains the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in trials (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactation hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dyspaggia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stools, oessophagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of the musculature, neck pain, neck pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency are possible and there was no causal connection with these events established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrobial agent that promotes the consolidation of the microtubules from the tubula and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin imparts the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 Albuminrezeptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the albuminous protein SPARC (cream protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two creamy unlinked studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 than 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% for metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-Line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Level 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to sound baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with an intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) after a solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urea was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the Metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients over 75 years of age, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light above 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, caution should be observed when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane breakthrough bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid material.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water bottle for at least 2 minutes should be swivelled slowly and carefully and / or inverted until complete suspension of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitations or smelines are visible, the water bottle has to be inverted again gently in order to achieve a complete reset in front of the application.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that seamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, in which complications may occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with seamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make an own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">Patients with chronic renal insufficiency or patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be controlled prior to treatment to make sure there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anemia may be caused by erythropoietal deficiency, or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, capable of producing epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with the reference drug as an injection into a vein as part of a major study with 479 patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to either Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study where the effects of seamed seamed under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to seamed were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of seamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging, migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Seamed must not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for seamed according to the regulations of the European Union, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that stores seamed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals across all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG for the placing of seamed in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">The treatment of anaemia and reduction of the need for transfusion in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the beginning of chemotherapy) exists.</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / l], no iron deficiency), if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned large operating procedures, which require large amounts of blood for women; 5 or more blood vessels in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, seamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and tortures may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa-dose should be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required to control the symptoms of anemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value increases by at least 1 g / kg (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte value by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the hemoglobin value increased by ≥ 1 g / kg three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte value by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value has increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, an analogy to the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood conserae is required, should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins to provide large iron reserves before the start of the seamed phase therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once weekly for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis over the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medication into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from the treatment with any erythropoietin at erythroblasteria (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblasting).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are not eligible for a larger electro-orthopaedic surgery and which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, escort or scandrovascular disease; in patients with recently joined cardiac infarction or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastampenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the common causes of failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminescence, infections or hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticulocytes "index"), is decreased (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow should be considered for diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of seamed in patients with a risk for an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration recommended in section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed if erythropods-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the administration of epoetins if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of anemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and coronary coronary heart disease or insufficiency in maintenance therapy, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa is not accelerated in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not dialysis, the progression of renal insufficiency is not accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumour patients under chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may need to be transfuntioned).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapyanemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take account of the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger, elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, before the start of epoetin-alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing large elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate prophylactic prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events may persist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when hemoglobin was targeted at 12-14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporine dose should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no indication of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in relation to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Over thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarcts, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thromboses, arterial thromboses, aneurythromboses, retinal thromboses and 11 blood clots were reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetins.</seg>

<seg id="552">Depending on how your anemia refers to the treatment, the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor may, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well set, you will receive regular doses of seamed between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg twice weekly, distributed on two equally sized injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor may, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="556">Depending on how the anaemia appeals to the treatment, the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control.</seg>

<seg id="569">In addition, patients with disease Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (means against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclaa can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headaches.</seg>
<seg id="571">To treat the disease Paget may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Since the active substance in Aclaa is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material for Zometa was used for evaluating Acupa.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently suffered a fracture score; the number of fractures over a period of up to five years was examined.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclaa was tested in two studies of a total of 357 patients and compared with Risedron (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) normalized in the blood or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures was reduced by 70% in patients under Aclaa (without other osteoporosis treatment) over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Aclaa (with or without other osteoporosis treatment).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Acupa occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">It may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to cioledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclaa are exposed to the risk of kidney problems, reactions at the infusion place and osteoneconsis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclaa provides clarification material for doctors who prescribe Activia for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information about how to use the medicine, and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="586">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Contract indication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous 5 mg intravenous infusion is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture the administration of the infusion of Aclaa is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Acbasa should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget with Activia, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget for at least 500 mg of basic calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclaa (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently experienced low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Acupa infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Acupa can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Acupa is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary since bioavailability, distribution and elimination in elderly patients are similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, because data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">For patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), Acupa is not recommended because limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with aceta before the start of the therapy with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the fast implementation of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclaa (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget for at least 500 mg of basic calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclaa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids (poor oral hygiene) should be considered before using bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental interventions, no data is available, whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of acetaba can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclaa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of atrial fibrillation reported by atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3.862) compared to those receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3.852).</seg>
<seg id="608">Osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) were the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclaa (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction coledron acid has been associated with kidney function disorders, which act as a decrease in the kidney function (i.e. increasing the serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Kreatinine-Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and impaired renal function were in a clinical study of osteoporosis in three years comparable between the placebo and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatinine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Acupa compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium levels that were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2,10 mmol / l) occurred at 2.3% of patients treated with Acupa in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with aceta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">In addition, all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis in the study for the prevention of clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on preventing clinical fractures after a littled hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclaa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of coledron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonekrosis in the maxillofacial area has been treated, especially in cancer patients, via osteonekroses (primarily in the jaw area), which have been treated with bisphosphonates, including coledron folic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study of 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area in one with Aclaa and patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdosing, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Acupa 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density value (7.736 females aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the Schenkelhal ≤ - 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric retinal fractures were significant over a period of three years and the frequency of one or several new vertebral fractures after one year (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo-patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetylene fractures yielded the same lasting effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclaa increased bone density along the lumbar spine, hips and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the hedgehog neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients who were treated with Aclaa (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose of osteoporotic disease, bone biopsies were taken out of the pelvic ridge.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison to placebo, a microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal Propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C-Telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients during periods of study.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Acupa reduced BSAP significantly by 30% after 12 months compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the placebo-treated group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the treatment in the HORIZON-RFT study increased BMD at all times compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">Over 24 months, the treatment led to an increase of the BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo and 4.3% at the threshold.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in males In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in men treated with acetone compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once yearly administration of aceta in comparison with the once weekly administration of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change in the BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment with the disease Paget of the bone Activia was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically approved, mainly mild to moderately heavy disease Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with the 2.6 to 3,0x age specific upper normal value when taken into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of risedron once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Aclaa and Risedron.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the 143 with Aclaa and 107 patients taking part in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response could be maintained in 141 of patients treated with tears, compared to 71 patients treated with risedronate, with an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of cioledron folic acid in 64 patients revealed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dossically independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma label quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the highest value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ a 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination round time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the t ½ -values above) probably represent fast resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the area below the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrom-P450-enzyme systems is unlikely, because Zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of cioledron acid correlated with the Kreatinine-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine-Clearance, and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction of up to 35 ml / min with no dose adjustment of the coledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest dose of intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC were 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of coledron folic acid in rats was administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose equivalent to the 6x of human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs, including the Gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphyse of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">On rats one observed teratogeneity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally, 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledron Acid is a representative of a substance class called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, above all estrogen, which are made of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in males.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the case of Paget's disease, bone reconstruction takes place too quickly, and new bone material is constructed unsorted, making the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclaa works by normalizing the bone structure, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and gives the bone its strength again.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="676">Please inform your doctor, pharmacist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken the medicine, even if it is not a prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor, it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines which are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Acupa together with food and drink, make sure that you take sufficient fluids in accordance with the instructions of your doctor before and after the treatment with Aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="679">Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year administered by your doctor or the nursing staff as an infusion in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="680">If you have recently broken the hips, it is recommended to make the administration of aceta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an infusion in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Activia works for a long time, you may need another dose only after one year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in your blood after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Activia can work longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Acupa is missed, please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before ending treatment with Aclaa Falls you are considering ending treatment with Aclaa, please take your next doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion do occur very frequently (with more than 30% of patients), but are less common after the subsequent infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headaches occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="689">At present it is unclear whether Activia causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Activia.</seg>
<seg id="690">Physical signs because of a low calcium concentration in the blood, such as muscle cramps or tingling or deaf feeling, especially around the mouth.</seg>

<seg id="696">In patients with a recently experienced low-traumatic hip fracture it is recommended to perform the infusion of Aclaa two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="697">Before and after administration of Aclaa patients have to be sufficiently supplied with liquid; this is particularly important in patients receiving a diuretic treatment.</seg>
<seg id="698">Because of the fast implementation of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, temporary, sometimes asymptomatic, hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Activia.</seg>
<seg id="699">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of basic calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="700">In patients with a recently experienced low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the infusion of Aclaa.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPARA for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetic medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be adequately adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyurea or insulin, the current dose of the sulfonyharnant or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acettos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulphonic resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, which means that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of acettos in tripletherapy was examined; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyurea, in addition, they received either Actos or Placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Acettos led to a decrease in HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced in doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletion study, the effect of the additional administration of acettos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyresurea showed a decrease in HbA1c values by 0.94% while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of acettos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who received Actos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesis (reduced susceptibility to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Acettos can neither be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that within the framework of a monotherapy (in the sole use), Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients whose metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approved for the placing of Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficiently adjusted with insulin and in which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">The use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age is not available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated output liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the Liver Enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper abdomen problems, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone continues, should be led to the presence of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which may arise from fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction in the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrence by 3.1-2% and hematocrence by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyurea or as a two-fold combination therapy with insulin is the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a reduction in visual acuity was reported in the treatment with thiazole india, including pioglitazone, occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but promising physicians should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report disorders of visual acuity, a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3,5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment should be dismissed (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blockers, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in lowering the AUC from pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone, the hypercholesterolaemia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother's animal decreases and therefore the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (invaluable from available data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the tower and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, ALT ascents performed more often than placebo over three times the upper limit of the normal range, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyresurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo when pioglitazone or pioglitazone respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, insufficiency has rarely been reported in Pioglitazone, but more often if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of messages of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in the treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures were performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparable medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days appeared no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to be activated via activation of specific cell receptors (PPAR-γ), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclincide as a monotherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time up to the release of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy started, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of optimization with insulin, were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol levels as well as a marginal, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol level have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclincide, and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed in Pioglitazone whereas lower levels of metformin and Gliclincide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides but also improved the postpranidal elevated triglyceride level, this has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised to either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the top concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness in approximately three times the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have demonstrated that Pioglitazone has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in rotting (55%) and a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unmodified pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and all active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearances of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicology studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone, the hypercholesterolaemia resulting in the gestation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the parent and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolidindians led to increased frequency of colonic tumours.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white until whitish, round, flat and carry the inscription "30" on one side and the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3,5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were investigated with Pioglitazone or Gliclincide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides but also improved the postpranidal elevated triglyceride level, this has an effect on the Tryglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target with respect to its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularisation and revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long-term risks associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white until whitish, round, flat and carry the inscription "45" on one side and the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients who received comparative medication showed an increased incidence of fractures in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3,5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>

<seg id="874">Any change concerning starch, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA compared to insulin in animal origin) can cause a change in dosing.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his physician, as such trips may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always for other drugs taken from them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in non-controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system - The peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>

<seg id="884">General illnesses and ailments at the place of administration - Local hypersensitivity reactions at the injection site During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma can occur at the injection site).</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system - urticaria, exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneuroteric edema, breathing problems, heart palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemia can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape picking, candy, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a designated assistant or given by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the effective maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of splitting (hydrolysis) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional clinical studies, toxicity, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular danger for humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane breakthrough bottle was removed from the refrigerator - to increase the insulin temperature at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resusurned in accordance with the instruction manual for the first use.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Because there are no experiences in children and adolescents, the use of Febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Organ transplant recipients Since there are no experiences with organ transplant recipients, the application of Febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">In patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure, treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other drug-like medicines, acute gout attacks may occur during the course of treatment, because uretic acid deposits in the tissue can first be mobilised by lowering the serum.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. with malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan-syndrome) the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases can increase so far that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver diseases During phase 3 clinical studies, slight abnormalities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3,5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the treatment and in the course of the course (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophyllin Zwas not performed any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition leads to an increase in theophylline level (inhibiting the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen was associated with an increase in Febuxoar exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothazide / Vardyin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving test subjects, 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily had a mean 22% increase in the AUC of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide slows the absorption of febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decrease in Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC causes.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancies cannot be associated with side effects of febuxostat on the pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious at controlling a vehicle, operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostats compared to the Allopurinol group in the pivotal study phase 3 (1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects associated with the medicine in the treatment groups and reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once, are listed below.</seg>

<seg id="1204">The events related to long-term follow-up studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patients), according to the indications occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported in pivotal studies of Phase 3 for these doses at all or with a lower frequency:</seg>

<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority in both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventionally used doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed statistically significant superiority in both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the usual dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1216">The lowering of the serum urine acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum cholesterol insufficiency &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>

<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was reached at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage response of serum levels in patients, regardless of their kidney function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum-acid-acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum-acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected during two years of the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum levels of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients needed a treatment against a poisonous feed in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of the patients needed no treatment against spilling).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout, which resulted in a complete disappearance of the lymph nodes up to 24% in 54% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH values (&gt; 5.5 µs / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface area below the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose increased proportionally.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For dosages between 120 mg and 300 mg, a rise in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is larger than the dosisproportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day, the Cmax amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decline in serum's acid concentration, provided that this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat lies between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma connection of Febuxostat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary bond to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid is mainly produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was found in the urine as unaltered Febuxostat (3%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the stool found itself as unaltered Febuxostat (12%), Acylglukuronid of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average total AUC of Febuxostat decreased about 1.8 times from 7.5 m / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver Dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- Pugh-Classification A) or medium-heavy (Child-Pugh classification B) Liver dysfunction, the Cmax and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites changed significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats a statistically significant increase of urine testes (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, in approximately 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purinmetabolism and urine composition and considered irrelevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that Febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In case of high doses, which were about 4 times the human-therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, which accompanied by lowering the Aufzuchtower and a development delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient may not lie down until after the first eating of the day, which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than for those who only received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data showing that the Alendronate dosage contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints), and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), ulcer (ulcera), tumbled abdomen (bloated stomach) as well as acidic shocks.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components ADROVANCE can not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be used in esophagus diseases, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following tips are to be followed carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or decompose the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract except pyloroplasty, are only given with special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal responses such as oesophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal lines, were reported in patients taking Alendronate (some of them were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate potential palsy reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend the medicine and seek medical advice in case of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dyspaggia, pain during swallowing or retroactive pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects appears to be elevated in patients who do not use the medicine properly and / or continue taking it after symptoms caused by an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While there was no increased risk in large-scale clinical studies with alendronate, stomach and duodenal ulcera, some of them severe and with complications, were rarely reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimens predominantly contain intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There is no data available to indicate whether to replace a bisphosphonate therapy in patients who need a jaw-surgical procedure, reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the treating physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that when taking a dose ADROVANCE they should take the tablet the next morning after they have noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but keep taking one tablet a week as originally planned at the scheduled weekday.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronate before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, alendronate was taken in clinical trials in common with a wide range of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor by breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate leave no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoarthritis of the jaw has been reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports stem from cancer patients, but also osteoporosis symptoms have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, derivatives of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) were observed in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The therapeutic equivalent of Alendronate once a week 70 mg (n = 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n = 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) as well as in the fracture intervention trial (FIT: n = 6,459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In the phase III studies, the moderate ascents of the BMD with Alendronate 10 mg / day amounted to 8.8% on the spine after 3 years, 5.9% on the femur and 7.8% at the trot.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronate, a reduction of 48% (alendronate 3.2% compared to placebo) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the ascents of BMD of vertebral column and trot continued to continue; the BMD of the femur and the entire body was also maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled trials that Alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg. a day either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily administration of alendronate reduced the incidence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (Alendronate 7,9% compared to placebo 15,0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Absorption Based on an intravenous reference dose, the average oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nightly fasting and two hours before the intake of a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability decreased by about 0.46% and 0.39% if Alendronate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis, alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily over five days) led to no clinically significant change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Alendronate is temporarily distributed in tissue tissues after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but is then rapidly circulated into the bone or excreted with the urine.</seg>

<seg id="1330">After the intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronat 71 ml / min and systemic Clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, Alendronat is not excreted via the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys, and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other medicines by these transport systems.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Absorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men) after the application of ADROVANCE, after nightly fasting and two hours before the intake of a meal, the middle area below the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-120 h) for vitamin D3 is 296.4 ng • h / ml (without taking into account an endogenous vitamin D3-mirror).</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were presented to 668 patients with kidney transplant, with the application of anagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a year of treatment (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant were carried out and investigated, as Advagraf is taken up by the body in comparison with Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this drug or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; Modification of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the strict control of a medical device experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a change to an alternative formulation, therapeutic pharmaceutical supervision and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus test mirrors should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a Talking level, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate postoperative period.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a substance with low clearances, an adaptation of the advance dose can take several days until the steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application For the suppression of graft rejection, the immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral anagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may later become necessary, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral anagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from prograf to advagraf is a transplant recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to be converted to a once daily intake of anagraf, so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), in relation to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressants to an anagraf once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral and liver transplants must begin with the oral initiation dose for the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are converted to an anagraf, an initial initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients - although there is no clinical experience with anagraf in lung, pancreatic and colon transplanted patients, occurred in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in case of transplanted patients in an initial initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood tal mirroring in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to decrease the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Because kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can be assumed that dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including regular determination of the serum cholesterol level, a calculation of the creatinininity and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporto to Advagraf With the conversion from a Ciclosporto to a Tacrolimus based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of full-blood Tacrolimus test controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus test levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow levels of Tacrolimus should also be checked after conversion from prograf to an anagraf, dose adjustment, immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances which could change the Tacrolimus complete blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases, if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley level of Tacrolimus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and cardiac and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and cardiac transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of Tacrolimus under- or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; Modification of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the strict control of a medical device experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have proven to be treated as therapy-resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart grafts and graft recipients in childhood, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal medicines during a treatment with Advocamum (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus blood-mirrors may be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septum hypertrophy designated as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under anagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart condition, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malignant skin lesions by appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES like headaches, altered state of consciousness, cramps and blurred vision should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">As an anagraf of hard capsules, retarded, lactose contained, special caution is given in patients with rare hereditary Galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood level with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interaction was achieved with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Tacrolimus's effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; hence, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, it is especially cautious when taking decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal tests have shown that tacrolimus can potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong its half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies on transplant patients do not indicate that under Tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with the treatment with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialysiable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The effect of tacrolimus by its binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cell inner, are likely to be mediated at the molecular level.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumsensitive inhihibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a specific series of lymphoma genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus inhibits the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, and the formation of lymphocycines (like interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies was consistent with the observations in the large studies where prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and cardiac transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multicenter study with oral Prograf, more than 110 patients were reported who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomization.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the unbound faction of Tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearances observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the elimination occurs mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than Prograf in stable patients (twice a day) in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advocates are used to treat bleedings or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Haemophilia A patients suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was inserted, which it empowers to form the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding into 86% of 510 new blood counts with "excellent" or "gut" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocates may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted approval to Baxter AG to the establishment of lawyers in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depends on the severity of factor VIII deficiency, the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following haemorrhagic events factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, a proper determination of factor VIII plasma level is recommended to control the dose and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">In their response, individual patients may differ by factor VIII, perform various in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within the interval of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dose rate should be based on the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of haemophilia A patients.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the prooagulatory activity of factor VIII-oriented IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of inhibitors is correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the risk of being greatest in the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposures and anamnestic known inhibitors, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, reoccurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of Factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients showing a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of each patient (234). the unexpected drop in the blood clotting factor VIII-Spiegels occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient with continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and both the Factor VIII- mirror in the plasma as well as the Clearance-Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperatively.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2,4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days with ADVATE.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, a FVIII inhibitor was observed in none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial, 5 of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE was treated with inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titer against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, preuritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes was reported in several repeated product expositions as part of the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">For this reason, the CHMP is based on the ADVATE's safety profile, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, it is decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further extension in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited (CHMP) officially shared the Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company accepts its application for the placing of Advexin on the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have injected directly into the tumors, allowing cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene present in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, where Li-Fraumeni-cancer occurred in the area of the abdomen, bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the company's answers to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP will prepare a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore has advantages for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexim can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programmes with lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changing active ingredients" means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are diskled.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be relied on constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms in addition to constipation of the nose, the patients receiving aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or laureadiene (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from congenital glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (overfunction of the thyroid), or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of aerinaze in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking it or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data, aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after symptoms of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days since the activity of pseudoephedrine decreases with time for long-term use.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors resp. within the 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, liurid, cabergolin, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data does not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction, and the data does not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertonia • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol were administered additionally, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with either desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not that was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In vivo CYP3A4 inhibited and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies showed no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness, which may result in impairment of the airworthiness or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, prevalent pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is especially likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary starre and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Lloratadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both trials, the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine during the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nose-mucous swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after the plasma was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the fluid balance of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multidose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, four subjects of desloratadin were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine according to the sole application of pseudoephedrine bio equivalent to exposure to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">However, based on conventional clinical studies on security harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not allow any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the pharmacovigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose and glowing or itching eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed with you under the application of aerinaze: • High blood pressure • heart hunting, palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Traffic tightness and the operation of machines When using the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerinaze leads to drowsiness or reduces the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you have forgotten taking Aerinaze If you have forgotten to take a dose in time, pick up the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, severe allergic reactions (breathing difficulty, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rashes have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart hunting, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, insomnia with increased physical activity, cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspicuous liver flukes was also very rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies of about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by investigating the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the squads, impairment of sleep and performance in days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to take and utilize the enamel tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the scores (scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both trials in Urticaria, the reduction of the scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, laureadiene or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for placing an agreement on the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have ended and can be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persistent allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the period of allergy.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazol were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness, which may result in impairment of traffic resistance or ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1,2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 adolescents from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, which occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and at 6.9% of the patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multidose study involving up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-phase clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses where desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dosage) was administered over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Lloratadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, nasal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall core of the questionnaire regarding the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamination is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that, besides chronic idiopathic urticaria, it is expected to improve the symptoms even in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the rate of the disease by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced sleep and wakefulness as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, where patient demos were comparable with the overall seasonal allergic rhinitis population, a higher concentration of desloratadin was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulus after daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced to the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company accepts its application for the placing of Aflunov on the prevention of the aviar H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect against influenza caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic occurs when a new strain of the flu virus is emerging, which can easily be spread by humans, because humans have not built up immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the influenza virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to make antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this trunk.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane covering of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognises as foreign) was purified and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like further information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Abogenerase is available as a solution to intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir, since the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Aboatase should only be prescribed when the doctor has tested which antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of kritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Abogenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Aboatase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood when used in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids not cure can, however, delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Aboatase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Agenerase, which was enhanced with low dosed kritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to take protease inhibitors earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or changing the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not taken a protease inhibitor after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Abogenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors responded very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drugs used with Ritonavir decreased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenase, together with Ritonavir, came to a stronger decline in the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who took their protease inhibitors further:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Abogase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea, nausea, vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Abogase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amicolite or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Generic Abogwort can also not be used in patients, the St. John's Wort (an herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines that are degraded in the same way as atase and are harmful to health in high concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abogenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children were outweighed over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Asgenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of Abogenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally licensed under exceptional circumstances, as only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited approved for the placing of Abogenerase in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Aboatase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, amniotic capsules should be given to the Pharmacokinetic Booster of Amprenavir along with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of AMprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient's pretreatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to take-in is 14% lower than Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, ageneric capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Aboatase capsules is 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Abogenerase capsules are used without the increased addition of kritonavir (booy), higher doses of Abogase (1200 mg twice daily) have to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Aboatase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of ammonia which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Abogase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Aboatase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Aboatase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Concurrent application should be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Generic Abochrom may not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used as a result of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Abogenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including the treatment with Abogenerase, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Abogenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previously reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including the Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Because the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of atherase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these drugs at the same time, Abogase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with detonavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with AMprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are also administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Abogenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Abogase should be removed for a duration of 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that could be used to treat medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors associated with prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of hemmophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemmarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defects, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index) cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutical width cannot be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutical width Abogase with kritonavir must not be given along with medicines, whose active ingredients are mainly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC by amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a development of resistance.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with kritonavir, very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of AMprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already uses St. John's wort, the prenatal mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, by 30% lower for Cmax when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of Amprenavir were used twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin-values of Amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but a close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosine in combination with didanosine, but it is recommended that Didanosine and Agenerase's revenues are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz combined with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and available limited data suggests that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amicolite.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir is difficult on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is advised, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2.69fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including mediums, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may result in interactions with ageneric kinase, possibly causing interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with ageneric term.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids cannot be taken at the same time as Abogase as it may result in resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants, known as enzyme reductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of ammonia.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, ni</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with Abogenerase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of aserase with kritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are to be expected to increase the level of plasma levels while administration of ageneric gases.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may result in myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this medicinal product is not recommended by Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while offering Amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore Abogenerase cannot be used together with oral mdazolam (see section 4.3), while caution is required while using Abozolam with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around the 3- to 4-barrel.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If Methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are also administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation of how to adapt the dose of the Amprenavir dose if Amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with atase, increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or amplification of the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of kritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (such as desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous administration of agenase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactation rats, Amprenavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known if Amprenavir passes into the breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the intervention in the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the seed, including fertility and reproductive ability, was not affected by the administration of the mold on the parent animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Abogenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Abogase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether or not they are associated with the use of Aboatase or another drug used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of recurring laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and faecal fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation (bull jackets).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretrovirally not pre-treated persons treated with Amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / Zidovudin for a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (pens) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 at 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients suffering from indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macular-papulous nature, with or without itching, and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amprenavir had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defects, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients receiving 600 mg of asrease each day together with low dosed kritonavir (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) to those who were observed under any atase treatment; an exception formed increases in triglyceride and CPK values, which occurred in patients who received agenase along with low dosed kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinuria with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir lies in the range between 0,012 and 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and amounts to 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretrovirally not previously treated patients with the currently approved hypotheavir / kritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir treatment schemas with proteaseinhibitors - the described mutations rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen out of 434 antiretrovirally-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of kritonavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48 with 14 isolates genotypically investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic isolation of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / M / V, Q58E, D60E, I82A / I, I82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its APV30005 extension (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of kritonavir twice a day: n = 107) in patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing based analysis systems can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance to the presence of the mutations V32I + 147a / V, I84V, and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with ritonavir and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes due to additional data and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance tests, clinical validated pherotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir produces a certain cross resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir is generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretrovirally not pre-treated patients, in which a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), quinavir (three of 24 insulates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 Isolates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a seeding therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that may adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Abogase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which PI pretreated adults received after virological failure (600 mg twice daily) and Nuclear osidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard of care (SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Abogenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-subsuperiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subcutaneous threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of inborn atase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 had been pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase's solution for taking and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose of kritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks about 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of "unbiased" ageneric term should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, reduced for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as unimpeded penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active agent in the plasma, with the amount of unconnected ammonia which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines which induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time with Abogase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily asprenavir exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable from the solution than from the capsules; therefore, agenerase solution and aggeneric capsules are not exchangeable on a milligrammbasis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amonavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amuprenavir plasma levels comparable to those who are obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Amprenavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for carcinogenicity in mice and rats, hepatellular adenomas occured in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily offering of 1200 mg of amatear.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinoma has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and In-vitro Genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations of human peripheral lymphocytes, Amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical studies, no significant liver toxicity has been observed in patients, neither during the administration of asgenerase after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on the toxicity of young animals that were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with detonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus elongation and minor skeletal changes were observed that indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Abogenerase capsules are used without the increased addition of kritonavir (booy), higher doses of agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) have to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Aboatase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of ammonia which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Concurrent application should be performed with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Abogase should be removed for a duration of 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with drug-dependent factors such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin-values of Amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but a close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz combined with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir is difficult on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>

<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with atase, increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or amplification of the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg Ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the intervention in the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding period, showed a diminished increase in body weight during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of Abogenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdosing, the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir lies in the range between 0,012 and 0.08 µM in infected cells and amounts to 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefit of "unbiased" ageneric term should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss..</seg>

<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to take-in is 14% lower than Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, ageneric capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2102">In addition, as no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of Agenerase can be given to intake and low dosed kritonavir, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although dose adjustment is not deemed necessary for Amprenavir, an application of Agenerase is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Because of the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glycol content, Agenase is a solution for taking small children and children under the age of 4, with pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>

<seg id="2195">The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips, or hairline was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's discomfort or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break can be done several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there are currently no data on long-term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment, other suitable therapy forms should be considered in case of superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, there is no clinical experience, therefore the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tumors (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not studied for the treatment of acute keratose on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lipid.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Only very limited data are available about the application of imiquimod for the treatment of acute keratose in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the underarms and hands do not support the efficacy in this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity or go back after the treatment with Imiquimiodine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 active lesions showed less complete healing rates than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune stimulating properties, Imiquimod can be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although the serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) have been quantifiable neither after one-off nor after repeated use of the topical application, no recommendation can be given for use during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">Local reactions to the treatment of the fungal warts (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod) were the most common adverse events associated with Imiquimod-cream in the studies of three times weekly treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of imiquimod cream in connection with side effects include discomfort at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Basaliom patients treated with imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod-Cream related adverse effect, were in these studies a reaction at the application place (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects indicated by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical studies of phase III with imiquimod-cream treated patients with actinic keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs, provided according to the test plan, shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with Imiquimod-Cream, it often came to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreting / leaving / dropping (23%) and oedema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical evidence provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod-cream, severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%) and heavy scoring and rusting (19%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratose, alopecia with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) was observed at the treatment site or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental, unique oral absorption of 200 mg Imiquimod, corresponding to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The most clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotonia, normalized after oral or intravenous dehydration.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetical study, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the fungal warts in an imiquimod treatment is significantly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of patients who were treated with imiquimod, the disease was completely cured; this was the case at 20% of the patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 male patients treated with imiquimod versus 5% of 161 treated male patients (95% CI:</seg>
<seg id="2225">Imiquimod's efficacy of five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically exiled and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod with three weeks weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic action lesions within a related 25 cm2 treatment area on the hairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing following one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external coworrhages, actinic keratose and superficial basal cell carcinoma do not normally occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimiodine cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three week use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml at the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of imiquimod was low according to topical application on MC-sick skin of patients aged 6-12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the dermal toxicity of rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study for the dermal application carried out for four months also yielded no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with dermal administration on three days a week did not induce tumors at the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, there is a risk for the human being to view as very low due to the systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream before and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimod will pass into the breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of incisions, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream on the clean, dry skin with the inclination warts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints which complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with resuscisers, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of the GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) include headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat, fever, and reactions at the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are higher blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review every year all new information that may be known, review and, where necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">Aldurazyme is a manufacturer of patients who receive alumacyme with respect to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. an approval for the placing of Aldurazyme in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be performed in an appropriate clinical environment where recovery facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients with IgG antibodies are expected to form antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of treatment must be cautious.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before starting infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyreagents) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single serious infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the previous response occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical studies were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions associated with Aldurazyme, observed during Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older, are performed in the following table according to the following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing stillness and facial oedema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Medications related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe follow-up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenous once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconversion occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment, whereby the patient at the age of 5 with a heavier driveform usually came to a seroconversion (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature excretion from the study) no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients with whom it never came to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal or minor neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidal activity in vitro that did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Following intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of the patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the total distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement in lung function and ability to be cured in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">The 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg creatinine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients being taken into account by using a combined end point (expected percentage of normal FeV, range in the 6-minute walk, range of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted to study the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients, which were 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with a severe follow-up form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased Gag- levels in urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a growth of magnitude (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) was observed after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas the older patients with a severe follow-up form had limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenous once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2347">Instructions for use - dilution and application The concentrate for the production of an infusion solution must be diluted before application and is provided for intravenous application (see information for doctors and medical professionals).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient tolerates this, gradually increases to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I- implicated involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, however, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing stillness and facial oedema.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence in more than 1 out of 10 patients): • headaches • nausea • abdominal pain • skin rash • Joint pains, joint pain, back pain, pain in arms and legs • Increased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the infusion site</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the packaging contributions will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not used immediately, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, provided the dilution was under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • First measure the number of water-thinning perforations after body weight of each patient.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer), and "malignant" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squamous epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapies, as sole therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the application of cisplatin, an "antiemetic" (drugs against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent fluid deficiency) should be given before or after the application of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood flow changes or if certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, reduced or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetremixed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetrexed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural amelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another anti-cancer drug).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another anti-cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in 1 725 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin lived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Patients who previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time of 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells, in the administration of Alimta, longer survival rates than with the comparison drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted permission to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the placing of Alimta in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each feed bottle needs to be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose-sis is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma except for predominantly plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma apart from oversized plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface area (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell carcinoma after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, corticosteroids must be given on the day before and on the day of the pemetric dose as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetrexed at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first pemetry dose as well as after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetremixed a complete blood-image should be created before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times higher than the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dose test must take place taking into account the Nadir of the blood balance or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the predictive therapeutic cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery patients have to be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are to be applied for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient loses its value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dosages a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- continues in the appearance of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over, compared to patients aged 65 years, there is an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatine clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper bilirubin limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; 0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with regard to bone marrow technology and pemetremixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils again have reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platel- cyte number once again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophils, platelet count and maximum non-hematological toxicity as observed in previous treatment courses (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 haematological and non-maternal toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was considered when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetry must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for whom treatment with pemetremixed is planned must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of the outflow before the pemetric treatment is considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical studies with pemetremixed occasionally when this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible deterioration of reproductive capacity by pemetremixed, men ought to be advised prior to the treatment of Ginn to obtain advice regarding sperm preservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) may result in reduced pemetry elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advised if patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) can be used high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed are avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with pemetremixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetry.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the clotting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy calls for an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There is no data for the use of pemetry mixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- re antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during an application in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy, unless absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity by pemetremixed, men should be advised prior to the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetremixed is transferred to breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma, and the randomized Cisplatin and Pemetrexed-held as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2430">There were reported cases of radiation pneumonitis in patients who were irradiated before, during or after their pemetry treatment (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (pemetremixed) is a antineoplastic anti-folate, which exerts its effect by interrupting important and acid-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetrexed acts as an antiflate with several points of attack by blocking the thyme dylatasthase (TS), Dihydrological reductase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are followed by the following key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomized, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin with malignant pleural amesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically meaningful advantage of survival compared to those patients who were only treated with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medication in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnoe) in relation to the malignant pleural amelioma was demonstrated in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the single Cispla- tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement in lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a worsening of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with an easily hypocaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and young people under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimal, it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting treatment with alli, because the dose of antidiabetic should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted.</seg>

<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma label was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When applying warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (international normal ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take supplements of the multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the application of a one-time dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decline of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed for a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal and are related to the pharmacological effect of the medicine, since absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects observed after the market launch of orlistat is not known, since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of an unknown size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† Es is plausible that treatment with alli may cause anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were given for normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Most of the reported cases of orlistat overdosing were either reported to have either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the lipid properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is applied in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-rest of the gastrisch and pankreatic lipasa.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have shown that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 determine the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies weight loss was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred during the first six months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average figure in the Gesamtcholesterin amounted to 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo -2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average LDL Cholesterins changed with orlistat 60 mg-3.5% (initial value 3,30 mmol / l) and with placebo -3.8% (initial value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the mean change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (starting value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be found sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) without signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-shaped leucine group), were identified, which represented nearly 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as for chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-Hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was examined in 1 842 adult patients who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the case of chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued approval to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: in order to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in case of strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in cases of chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since palonosetron can prolong the colon assay, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with the simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi shall neither be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose palonosetron and a Steady State- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population it was shown that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (amiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearing of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common adverse events observed at a dose of 250 mcg (a total of 633 patients) that could at least be associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and palpation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reaction at the place of meeting (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not effective therapy for an overdose of alopia.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-life 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-life: 7.3 hours) received, which was given intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the study with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG-parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">After intravenous administration a gradual decrease of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosisproportional in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μ of kg / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following the intravenous administration of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentrations was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron in 3 consecutive days the overall composition (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the one-time dosage of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated via the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on the metabolism, CYP2D6 and CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as immutable active substance made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous stub injection in healthy eyes, the overall length of the body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequately above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, clues showed that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose accounted for about 30x of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined for one-time application, the relevance of these results is considered low for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The European Commission must inform the European Commission on the plans for the placing of the drug approved within the framework of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the promise of approval for the placing of the treatment intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same medicinal component that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In microscopic examination, liver tissue damage causes damage, and the values of the Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood are also increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast produced by a gene (DNA) that stimulates it to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was treated (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was reduced to more patients than with the reference drug; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) are not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirs (crack or cuts), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methiciline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not affect this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the area to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was diskled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients in placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin cells, altargo and cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were examined by skin-dogs, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the order place.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for placing an advertisement in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitization or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin ointment the treatment should be aborted, the ointment must be carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary open wounds, the efficacy of retinapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected place after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous use of retinapamulin and other topical means on the same skin area has not been examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical use on abraded skin or infected surface wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo cannot be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 The average Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% retapamulin ointment increased by 81% after a simultaneous oral application of 2-times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure after topical use in patients, dose adjustment is not required if topical retinapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral ingestion and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">During pregnancy, Retapamulin ointment should only be used when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinapamulin is preferable to the administration of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the treatment with altargo should be continued / terminated, it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefits of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which were applied to altargo, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the place of meeting that entered about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passangers (formerly Purotus passangers).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of retinapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site in the 50s subunit of bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptide transfer center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the local prevalence of resistance affect the use of retinapamulin at least some infection forms, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of retinapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">In 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% retinapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and with the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1% salve to 200 cm2 shielded skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism In vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with less involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro screening of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rat microkernel test for in vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of secluded skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above), development toxicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The license holder must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The license holder commits to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan as described in Version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Issues for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted at the same time with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show you quit the application of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if any discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gauze band unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within the framework of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, with a protection against hepatitis B only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used if during the immunisation there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is assured that the vaccination plan that can be made out of two cans is to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the natural defences of the body) as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccines authorized since 1996, and the Vaccine used since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered within the framework of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix are contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix Adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month period and a 12 months gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix used between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to six and a 12 months distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a homologation for the placing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for primary dimming with Ambirix consists of two Vaccine doses, whereby the first dose at the date of the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster shot is desired for both Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines can be vaccinated or vaccinated using a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured that immunocompetent people who responded to Hepatitis A- vaccination need a booster shot as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in the case of non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibody-value is achieved after the basic dimming, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal impact, these injection routes should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneously, since in these cases it can come to bleeding after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussisation, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that no adequate immune response is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thiomerisation and preservative-containing vaccine formulated.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 Vaccine doses of Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturality on a calculation base per accination of Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the administration of a dose of 3-doses-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the volunteers who had received Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturation was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of deformed hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">Statistically, the percentage of vaccines reported about severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine as with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of deformed hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B virus was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were performed in vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month of 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month of 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher compared with Ambirix after the 3 dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses reported in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both trials received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of deformed hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of malininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- including 15-year-olds it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was given at the same time with the booster shots of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussisation, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccines (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-Rimmed vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and serum conversion rates for the current formulation as for the previous formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus-containing foods and beverages, but can also be transmitted by other means, such as by bathing in waters contaminated by water.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccinations (although you / your child may not feel ill or ill at the time of the vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those in hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If an allergic reaction has occurred to you or your child for an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly protect against Hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vaccination).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per accination (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B virus).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give your child a vaccination protection before finishing the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected into persons suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defences / or if you / your child is undergoing a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take more drugs / receive (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated recently / or has been given or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix will not be given pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2798">♦ frequently (up to 1 drop per 10 dipped doses): • swelling at the injection point • fever (over 38 ° C) • dizziness • gastrointestinal discomfort</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects that have been reported for days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 impregnated doses) are:</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which has become known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP advocated that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperuric encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonium concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonte is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomy hose (through the abdominal wall in the stomach of the leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of the leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since ammonaps could not be compared to another treatment or with placebo (a pseudo drug, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonella can also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste experience, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonium in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonze was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because only limited information about this drug was available due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifected form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first life month), there is then an indication of the use in the anamnesis a hypertropic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disturbances, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually by taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyl is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or Orniintranscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disturbances because there is a risk for the emergence of esophagusulcera when the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and odema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylated butyrate over the liver and kidneys occurs, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">The subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in slowing neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of working nerve endings in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk in humans and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and at 78% of these undesirable events it was assumed that they were not connected to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">An abnormal toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactate, heavy hypokalemia, armoroctopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred during a 5 month old toddler with a single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose limiting neuro-toxicity with intravenous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stoichiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be thought to be produced for each gram of recorded sodium phenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen elimination (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartum (but within the first months of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during the course of the pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifected form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Orniintranscarpathian deficiency), which were recovered from a hypermetropic encephalopathy and then treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys via glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were calculated according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylated butyrate in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were determined 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cyklus or hemoglobin, phenylbutyrat (300 - 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) showed no phenylacetate in the plasma after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean Phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher in plasma levels compared to first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results obtained by the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylated rats did not have excised effects in toxic and non-toxic cans (examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules are either taken orally (infants and children who do not yet swallow pills, or patients with swallowing disturbances) or via a gastrostomas or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyl is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or Orniintranscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat flutes were suspended before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), lesions occurred in the pyramid cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">An abnormal toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactate, heavy hypokalemia, armoroctopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stoichiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess fat</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients suffering from disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that sodium phenylalbutyl is produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylated butyrate in granulate form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were determined 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product unparalleled for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylated butyl is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot escape the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS since sodium phenylbutyl is able to influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding you should not take AMMONAPS since the medicine could pass into the breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, obstruction of hearing, disorientation, memory problems and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice one of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating a suitable treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you have forgotten the intake of AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in the blood flow (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, swelling of the skin, nausea, constipation, unpleasant skin smell, rash, renal dysfunction, weight gain, and abnormal laboratory values.</seg>

<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS distributed on same single doses or via a gastric fimite (tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (tube, which is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take from the container a heaped spoonful of granulate. • Place a straight edge, e.g. a knife edge over the top edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess granulate. • Take the recommended number of spoons granules from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stem uplift" (abnormal measured value with electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at which the effect of angiox in the sole administration or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While PCI was often used to prevent the patient (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure), they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - was as effective in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox in terms of all indicators was as effective as heparin, with the exception of severe bleeding, where it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalidin, other hirudine or other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the placing of angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (instabile angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) with an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of angioxin in patients with ACS is an intravenous release of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If one PCI is performed in the patient, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours can be resumed according to clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">A bolus release of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angioxin in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus administration of Angiox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the incidence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to application and the dose can be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt is checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which were included, the ACT score was 5 minutes after the administration of the bivaliant-bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and patients with dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angioxy can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractioned heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular weight heparin.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalidin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though most of the hemorrhages of arterial punctuation occur in PCI patients under Bivalidin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can occur during the treatment in principle bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients with Warfarin and treated with Bivalidin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after decomposition of the treatment with Bivalidin again reaches the level prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mode of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocytenaggregate) it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalidin with platelet unit numbers or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters in any case are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalidator alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalidate plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractional heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleedings were significantly less common among bivalidators than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-inhibitor plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY bleeding was defined as one of the following occurrences: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or hemorrhage in the puncture area, reduction of hemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorrhalisations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" punctuation points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bivalidin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalidin group as well as in the comparison groups treated with heparin, women and patients over the age of 65 were more likely to suffer adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleedings occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system organclasses in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with a bivalidin is immediately aborted and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains a bivalidin, a direct and specific platinum inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as in the anion-binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thromboin is bound in the liquid phase or at barley.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalidin to thromboin, and hence its effect, is reversible because thromboin sways splits the binding of Bivalidin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalidin was able to induce thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalidin shows a dose and concentration dependent anticoagulatory effect, documented by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the patients, an additional bolus of 0,5mg / kg Bivalidin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before starting the angiography (at the time of randomization) or with PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before PCI) are shown in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel prior to angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY bleeding was defined as one of the following occurrences: intracranial, retroperito-neale, intraocular hemorrhage of ≥ 4 g / dl without apparent hemorrhage, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients exposed to a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalidin were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalidin as peptide has a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent re-evaluation of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolic rate resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thromboses is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of thromboses.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination occurs in patients with normal renal function after a process of first order with a temporal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional clinical studies on security harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular danger for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks with exposure to 10-fades of the clinical steady state plasma concentration) was limited to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects due to long-term physiological strain as a reaction to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short exposure comparable to those in clinical use, even with a much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the production of ready-to-use solution 17 is not under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over the age of six with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugars) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lucine is very slightly different from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short acting insulin ininsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In the case of type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes decreased by 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lifessions.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration decreased by 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lucine or any of the other components or patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adapted if administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH an approval for the placing of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or administered subcutaneously by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with impairment of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any changes in the active force, the brand (here-), the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc retarded, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can change the need for insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment schemas change.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances which can increase blood glucose activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia belong to oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of the adrenergic counter regulation can be deported or absent from the effects of limpic drugs such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidine and reserpine.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin-lucine passes into human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not enter into the breast milk, nor is it absorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following are the undesirable pharmaceutical ingredients known from clinical studies, grouped according to system organclasses and ordered after decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; not known (frequency on the basis of available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual vomiting or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive dog, changes of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is foamed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, can occur in the sequence a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucoagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by an appropriately trained person, or by an intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucagon injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal muscle and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the action occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in the normal insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin-related dosing ranges from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional glucose-lowering effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosesome effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lucine has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was clear that during an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a similar post-prandial glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin-lucine was reduced 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin-lucine is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, such as with human insulin, which is given 2 m- nudes before the meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lucine in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lucine in 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human Normal acting insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
